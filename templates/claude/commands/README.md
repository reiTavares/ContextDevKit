# Slash commands — domain taxonomy

> Closes [ticket 047](../../../vibekit/pipeline/conclusion/047-skill-packs-by-domain-subfolders.md).
> Claude Code resolves commands by **file basename**, not by path — so
> `/qa-signoff` finds `qa/qa-signoff.md` just as well as the flat layout.
> Subfolders are pure human navigation: the directory listing is no longer
> a 50-file scroll.

## Selection criteria for the root vs a pack

A command stays at the **root** when it's a *daily* invocation that you'd
type at the start of any session — `/state`, `/log-session`, `/new-adr`.
Everything else moves into a pack so the root list reads as "what most
sessions do, most days".

## Why not deeper nesting?

One level of subfolder is the budget. Two levels would re-create the
50-file scroll inside each pack, and Claude Code's command discovery
output (`/` autocomplete) flattens at one level anyway.

## What about basename collisions?

Forbidden by design — Claude Code's resolver picks the first match by
basename and the order isn't promised. A selfcheck assertion
(`tools/selfcheck-source.mjs`, `no command basename collides across
packs`) keeps the invariant honest.

## Adding a new command

1. Pick the pack (or stay at root for daily).
2. Drop `<name>.md` into the chosen directory.
3. Run `npm test` — the basename-collision check will catch any clash.

That's it. No registry, no manifest, no `_index.md`. Discovery is the
directory tree.
