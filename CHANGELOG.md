## [Unreleased]

_Nothing unreleased._

## [3.6.0] - 2026-07-17

### Added
- **WF-0068 — Multi-host, Installer & Rollout (BIZ-0003, ADR-0128
  §25/§26/§28/§29/§30/§31 + ADR-0129 — the FINAL workflow; program-integration +
  rollout authority; default-OFF preserved, guarded/strict flip human-gated).**
  Makes the Domain Engineering capability portable, installable and
  provably-activated — reuse-over-rebuild, no second installer/gate/registry.
  **Installer distribution** (the known gap): `copyEngine` distributes
  `policy/domain-engineering|devteam|domain-artifacts/` always-overwrite (the
  classifier's schema-coupled single source), `seedSubstrate` distributes
  `contextkit/skills/` via 3-way `syncTree`, and `uninstall --purge` removes both
  (reversible). **Host projections**: the two WF-0067 gate hooks
  (`domain-code-gate.mjs` PreToolUse + `domain-conformance.mjs` PostToolUse) wired
  at L≥4 into `settings-compose.mjs` + the Codex + Antigravity composers (block
  verb translated per host — genuine equivalence, not a declared limitation) and
  removed from the `selfcheck-gates.mjs` unregistered allowlist. **Fitness
  promotion**: the 8 Class-A domain rules promoted OBSERVE_ONLY→BLOCKING+ACTIVE
  together (armed-blocking invariant green; inert fleet-wide because
  `evaluateDomainFitness({}) === []` — no declared domain map ⇒ zero findings).
  **`/domain` diagnostic** (`domain-inspect.mjs`, observation-only; reuses
  `buildImplementationBlock`; `/implementation` dropped — §9 no distinct consumer).
  **§28 telemetry proof**: `precisionRecall` over `buildConfusionMatrix`, authority
  re-derived from the immutable provenance-tier table (self-report Tier D never
  promotes) — distinguishes actual activation from selection. **Staged-activation
  contract**: ships `enabled:false` + `rolloutStage:null` (inert); the
  shadow→advisory→guarded→strict ceiling is the human-gated fleet flip. Docs EN
  (`docs/how-to/use-domain-engineering.md`) + pt-BR (`instrucoes.md`). New
  `integration-test-domain-distribution.mjs` (16 checks: install/marker/
  block-proof-OFF/live-wire-ON/CLI/update/purge) + cross-host parity + §28 checks.
  Independent review (code-reviewer + devops + eval-designer) — no blockers.
  **BIZ-0003 program code-complete** (all 6 workflows done); G-MH4 approved.
- **WF-0067 — Enforcement & Architectural Fitness (BIZ-0003, ADR-0128
  §16/§19/§20/§23/§24/§29 + ADR-0129 — default-OFF, guarded flip human-gated).**
  Turns the shadow Domain Engineering capability into real deterministic
  enforcement by EXTENDING the existing gates — no second gate. Zero-dep PURE
  evaluators under `templates/contextkit/runtime/domain-engineering/` (exported
  from `index.mjs`): `code-gate.mjs` (`evaluateCodeGate` — the §16 two-axis
  verdict applicability×enforcement {ALLOW/WARN/ASK/BLOCK/DEGRADED};
  `resolveDomainMode` default-OFF level→mode ladder; `authoritativeCmis` — a real
  source write forces CMIS=100, §5, closing textual false negatives; `capMode` —
  the §29 staged-rollout ceiling that may only lower authority), `conformance.mjs`
  (`reconcileWrite` — §19 risk-banded drift: record / require-packet-update /
  block-next-write), `completion.mjs` (`evaluateDomainCompletion` — §20 obligations
  derived from the resolved profile only; no-code ⇒ zero obligations ⇒ allow),
  `project-map-compare.mjs` (`compareDomainToProjectMap` — §23 declared-vs-real
  delta). The eight DDD/architecture fitness functions + six advisory signals
  (§24) register into the EXISTING arch-debt catalogue via `makeFinding`
  (`arch-debt/domain-fitness{,-catalogue}.mjs`; `INITIAL_FITNESS_CATALOGUE` 9→23;
  `gate-context.mjs` adds `domainConformance`) — every rule ships `OBSERVE_ONLY`
  at launch so the gate stays PASS_WITH_OBSERVATION and native hosts stay green.
  Two DORMANT hooks (`domain-code-gate.mjs` PreToolUse + `domain-conformance.mjs`
  PostToolUse — built, correct, unwired, on the `selfcheck-gates.mjs` allowlist)
  plus the live `completion-gate.mjs` augmented with `augmentWithDomainCompletion`
  (config-gated default-OFF, fail-open). `tools/selfcheck-domain-enforcement.mjs`
  (46 checks: block-proof, authoritative fallback, fail-open degraded receipt,
  fitness blocking-vs-advisory, completion planned-vs-actual, the staged cap, and
  the false-block/false-pass negative matrix) wired into `selfcheck.mjs`. Class A
  deterministic-by-policy vs Class B predictive (ceiling guarded, never
  auto-strict); every layer default-OFF and fail-open with
  `allow-with-degraded-receipt`. Guarded/strict fleet activation + installer
  distribution are WF-0068.
- **WF-0065 — Native Lifecycle Orchestration (BIZ-0003, ADR-0128 §14/§15/§17 —
  advisory-by-default, shadow/config-gated).** Makes the Domain Engineering
  capability automatic across the host lifecycle by EXTENDING the existing hooks
  — no net-new classifier/registry/gate. A zero-dep runtime under
  `templates/contextkit/runtime/domain-engineering/`: `readiness.mjs`
  (`checkDomainEngineeringReadiness` — the §14 SessionStart probe that reads
  installed state and shapes a `domainEngineering` ledger block + short banner,
  ready/packet-missing/degraded/disabled, never dispatching an agent),
  `directive.mjs` (`extendExecutionContract` — the §15 mandatory
  `‹CONTEXTKIT-IMPLEMENTATION›` directive derived from the envelope's existing
  §15 block, never recomputing CMIS/DAS/profile), `spawn-record.mjs` (the §17
  planned-vs-dispatched-vs-completed evidence bridge over the EXISTING subagent
  substrate — an agent named in a prompt never counts, only a real spawn +
  recorded completion), and a pure `journey.mjs` for PreCompact domain-journey
  continuity. Wired into `session-start.mjs`, `boot-banner.mjs`, `ledger.mjs`,
  `execution-contract-hook.mjs`, `subagent-gate.mjs` and
  `compaction-continuity.mjs` — every wiring point config-gated **default-OFF**,
  additive and fail-open, so a non-adopting project (and every native host)
  boots byte-identical. `tools/selfcheck-domain-lifecycle.mjs` (27 checks) wired
  into `selfcheck.mjs`. Enforcement/guarded blocks are WF-0067; installer
  distribution + strict activation are WF-0068.
- **WF-0066 — Domain Artifacts & Task Compiler (BIZ-0003, ADR-0128 §13/§21/§22 —
  shadow-only).** The five deterministic domain artifacts (domain-map,
  aggregate, use-case, implementation-packet, implementation-receipt) as a
  policy table under `templates/contextkit/policy/domain-artifacts/`
  (`artifact-schemas.json`), each declaring `requiredForProfiles`/
  `neverForProfiles` so proportionality is data, not an if-chain: simple never
  gets a domain-map or aggregate; every code-mutation profile requires an
  implementation-packet. A zero-dep runtime under
  `templates/contextkit/runtime/domain-artifacts/`: `compileImplementationPacket`
  (composes the WF-0063 classification block verbatim), `buildImplementationReceipt`
  (planned-vs-actual diff — agent/skill/forbidden-path/contract deviations),
  `validateArtifact` + `checkProportionality`, and the Task Compiler
  `domain-implementation` recipe plus its four profile recipes
  (`recipe-contracts.json`) declared as DATA over the EXISTING
  `economy/tc-recipe-runner.mjs` DAG shapes — verified against the real
  `validateRecipe()` to prove reuse over forking a second compiler. Eleven
  governed scaffolds (`scaffold-contracts.json`) release only when their
  required contract artifact exists and validates, emitting typed
  `TODO:<field>` placeholders only — never an invented business rule.
  `tools/selfcheck-domain-artifacts.mjs` (46 checks) wired into `selfcheck.mjs`.
  Zero blocking power, zero hot-path wiring; installer distribution of the new
  policy tree deferred to WF-0068 (fail-open baseline until then).
- **WF-0064 — Devteam Agents & Skills (BIZ-0003, ADR-0128 §9-§12/§18 — shadow-only).**
  The devteam composition layer on top of WF-0063's classification. New policy
  tables under `templates/contextkit/policy/devteam/` (skills-registry,
  skill-triggers — the §11 truth-table as data, playbook — the 8-step §12 journey
  Classify→Model→Decide→Compile→Implement→Verify→Review→Receipt, reason-codes,
  manifest) and a zero-dep runtime under `templates/contextkit/runtime/devteam/`:
  `resolveRequiredAgents` (reuses the profile's minimumSquad verbatim — single
  authority), `resolveRequiredSkills` (deterministic CMIS/DAS/profile triggers;
  degraded table → recorded baseline, never a false pass), playbook accessors
  (`model` step profile-gated to domain-driven+ — simple work never gets domain
  ceremony), and the §18 skill-application receipt (`recordSkillApplication` —
  selection vs actual application evidence). The §15 envelope block's
  `requiredSkills` is now resolved from the trigger table (additive
  `skillsDegraded` flag; no module cycle). Six trigger-driven skill bodies under
  `templates/contextkit/skills/`. Two NEW devteam agents — **domain-modeler**
  (explicit model, aggregates only when invariants exist) and
  **implementation-engineer** (smallest safe diff, packet-first, tests with the
  code) — with §9 refusal lists, registry/routing entries and regenerated
  codex/antigravity projections; additive §10 domain-engineering upgrades to
  architect / code-reviewer / test-engineer / context-keeper.
  `tools/selfcheck-devteam.mjs` wired into `selfcheck.mjs`. Skills auto-apply by
  score — never by remembered slash command. Zero blocking power (dispatch =
  WF-0065, enforcement = WF-0067); installer distribution of the new policy/skills
  trees deferred to WF-0068 (fail-open baseline until then).
- **BIZ-0003 — Domain Engineering & Deterministic Implementation (proposed → approved).**
  Full Business package scaffolded under `contextkit/memory/business/BIZ-0003-…/`
  from the source plan, methodology to the letter: `business.json`, business-case /
  investment-decision / growth, 14 `architecture/*` docs (every plan section
  mapped), and 6 nested workflows **WF-0063..0068** (5 waves / 44 tasks each, last
  wave a human gate) governed by the new **ADR-0128**. Core ruling: *mandatory squad
  activation for code, proportional fan-out* (CMIS + DAS → Implementation Profile →
  minimum correct agents). Registries reconciled (work-context / workflow /
  decision). On explicit human authorization the Business was **approved**
  (`confirmed`) and **ADR-0128 accepted** (`covered`); **no workflow started**
  (`workflows.authorized=[]`), no production code. Planning artifacts only —
  gitignored `memory/`, no tracked changes.

### Fixed
- **Wave-gate evaluation now recognizes the full plan vocabulary + derives its
  facts from recorded evidence (ADR-0130).** The ADR-0101 wave engine's
  `evaluateMachineRequirement` (`workflow/gates.mjs`) only mapped six
  requirement names; every ADR-0128/BIZ-0003 wave plan declares a different set
  (`all-wave-tasks-done`, `acceptance-evidence-present`,
  `no-unresolved-critical-risk`, `human-approval-recorded`), which fell through
  to an unpopulated `requirementFlags` and could never pass — so a wave with
  every task recorded `done` still reported its gate `failed` and
  `close-wave --apply` refused forever (observed on WF-0063/0064/0066, all with
  empty `waveStates`). The engine now recognizes that vocabulary and derives
  `acceptance-evidence-present` / `no-unresolved-critical-risk` from the wave's
  **recorded agent-results** via a new pure, exported
  `deriveGateFacts({ tasks, taskStates, agentResults })` — a `done` status
  without a real result carrying `acceptanceMet[]` is NOT acceptance evidence
  (ADR-0128 evidence ruling). Human-mode tasks are excluded from the
  agent-completion facts (their completion is the explicit gate approval, via
  the exported `isHumanTask`). The human-gate safety property is untouched: a
  human gate never auto-passes from ctx; only `approveGate` with a named
  approver approves it, and unknown requirements still fail closed. 14 new
  checks in `tools/integration-test-workflow-gates.mjs`. WF-0064 and WF-0066
  waves were closed and their human gates (G-DA4, G-DM4) approved under this
  fix.

## [3.5.1] - 2026-06-28

### Added
- **Journey blocking gate (ADR-0127, Phase 2 — second cut).** A new PreToolUse
  (Edit|Write) hook (`runtime/hooks/journey-gate.mjs`) turns journey enforcement to
  **guarded + graceful fallback** (the ADR-0125 model, mirrors `simulate-gate`). It
  BLOCKS only a positively-FALSE checkpoint it can evaluate safely — a loose/central
  owned workflow (`workflowNestedUnderOwner=false`) or a forked/duplicate ADR series
  (`adrNumberContiguous=false`) — naming the exact corrective command. It DEGRADES to
  silent/advisory (exit 0, never blocks) on no active entity, unknown evidence, fresh
  install, non-guarded mode, or any error (fail-open). Honors exempt paths + a
  `BYPASS:` escape hatch. `policy/journey.json` `enforcement.mode` → `guarded`.

### Notes
- Over-block is the headline risk: `governingAdrAccepted`/`ownerContextExists` are
  deliberately **excluded** from the block set (they read false merely from being early
  → would false-block); they stay advisory and, for material work, are enforced by the
  existing ADR-0125 materiality gate. A 10-case over-block suite
  (`integration-test-journey-gate`) proves zero false-blocks.

## [3.5.0] - 2026-06-28

### Added
- **Methodology journey-map (ADR-0127, Phase 2 — first cut).** A canonical,
  checkpointed `policy/journey.json` (branches by work nature + ceremony) + a pure
  verifier (`runtime/work/journey-verifier.mjs`) that reports the current stage and the
  exact next command. Each request now prints a `‹CONTEXTKIT-JOURNEY›` advisory (current
  stage + next command), and the boot banner points at the checkpointed journey.
- **Registry-backed journey evidence** (`runtime/work/journey-evidence-registry.mjs`):
  real on-disk verdicts (ownerContextExists, workflow nesting, governing-ADR acceptance,
  no forked ADR series). Unknown checkpoints stay `pending` — never a false ✓.

### Fixed
- **Owned workflows now nest under their owner.** `createWorkflow` (the ADR-0057 pack
  path) placed owned workflows centrally instead of under
  `business|operations/<owner>/workflows/` (BIZ-0001 ownership rule 3). Now fixed;
  unowned workflows stay central.

### Notes
- Journey enforcement is **advisory** in this release; the blocking-checkpoint layer
  (guarded+fallback) is a deliberate follow-up (over-block risk).

## [3.4.2] - 2026-06-27

### Added
- **Native `/work` command (ADR-0126 Phase 1).** A first-class Claude Code entry
  point for the Business-driven methodology (intake → operation → nested workflow),
  driving the **host-neutral** `node contextkit/tools/scripts/work.mjs` — so Claude
  stops reaching for `ctx.mjs`/`cdx.mjs` (the Antigravity/Codex runners, which may
  not exist in a Claude-only install).

### Changed
- **Boot orientation now names the correct CLI.** The intake-gate boot banner
  recommends `/work intake "<objective>"` (was: only `/dev-start`) and shows the
  host-neutral path; `CLAUDE.md` gains an explicit `/work intake` step + a
  nest-workflow-under-owner reminder and lists `/work`.
- **Removed wrong-host runner leaks for Claude** in `workflow-assist` and the QA
  squad playbook (`node cdx.mjs …` → slash commands). Antigravity/Codex skill
  projections regenerated for command↔skill parity.

## [3.4.1] - 2026-06-27

### Added
- **Business-driven methodology auto-adoption on install/update (ADR-0126).** The
  installer now seeds the `memory/business/` + `memory/operations/` work-context
  roots WITH templates and scaffolds the Root Business **BIZ-0001** (status `draft`,
  placeholders only — never invents domain content), so the methodology is ACTIVE
  *and adopted* on a fresh install/`--update`, not merely available. Both summaries
  announce it loudly with the one adoption step (`work intake`). Idempotent +
  fail-open, with preflight-deferral parity and registry no-churn; opt-out via
  `config.methodology.autoSeed:false`. The three `memory/business/_TEMPLATE-*.md`
  documents are now seeded (`MEMORY_SEEDS`). New module
  `tools/install/seed-methodology.mjs` + regression suite `methodology-seed`.

## [3.4.0] - 2026-06-27

### Fixed
- Clean-clone CI portability (release-gating): `selfcheck-arch-debt-calibration` #370.2
  tolerates the valid unwired-floors state; `docs-reindex.mjs` skips gitignored meta files
  (CHANGELOG) and sorts directory entries by code-point for deterministic cross-OS idempotency.

### Added
- **BIZ-0001 design conformance — verbatim classifiers + two deterministic CLIs (OP-0005, ADR-0125 Accepted).**
  Intake/decision scoring tables now match the design specs verbatim: business-vs-operation
  §17 (+6/+4/+3/+2 weights; ≥8 & ≥op+3 → Business, ≥6 → Operation, near-tie → ask one
  clarifying question), execution-ceremony §18 (point bands 0-3 direct / 4-7 batch / 8+
  workflow + hard triggers), business-matching §19 (additive +100/+35/… ; 75/55 thresholds),
  decision-materiality §28 (+5/+4/+3/-10; bands 8/4) and ADR-search §29 (80/60). Two
  deterministic public CLIs shipped — `decision.mjs` (need/search/classify/create/link/
  accept/supersede/registry/render/validate/migrate-legacy) and the completed `work.mjs`
  (intake/link/unlink/promote/reconcile/start/close/validate), all `--json/--check/
  --dry-run/--apply`, atomic + idempotent. Intake emits a `‹CONTEXTKIT-CLARIFY›` question
  on near-ties; a decision-registry read-shim prefers `decisions/` then memory root;
  CLAUDE.md makes the intake ceremony a session-start obligation.
- **Enforcement ships guarded-by-default with graceful fallback (ADR-0125 — BREAKING).**
  `enforcement.mode` now defaults to `guarded` (was `advisory`): the intake ceremony is
  active for every install. Safe by construction — the gate degrades to advisory (warn,
  exit 0) whenever it cannot evaluate safely (no contract/signals, fresh install,
  registry-fail, unregistered task, any throw), so a fresh install is never false-blocked.
  Set `enforcement.mode='advisory'` to opt out, or `'strict'` to tighten. SessionStart
  surfaces intake readiness; gate block/degrade telemetry to `routing-decisions.jsonl`.
- **OP-0006 / WF-0060 economy canary prompt activation + quota writer.**
  Routing source defaults now start in `canary`; AGENTS/CLAUDE templates and
  dogfood prompts instruct agents to use economy mode by default, apply Task
  Compiler only on exact Project Map matches, render resume-pack on checkpoint,
  attach subagent-profile packets, use controller-scoped lean-loop in `/ship`
  and `/swarm`, and record quota observations only through the new explicit
  `economics/quota-snapshot.mjs --write` command. Codex and Antigravity
  projections were regenerated; quota stays `skipped` when host data is absent.
- **Architecture & Technical Debt Governance Gate (OP-0003, WF-0057, ADR-0122 Accepted).**
  Replaces the line-count-as-verdict tech-debt gate with a multi-dimensional gate
  (`architecture-debt-gate.mjs` + `arch-debt/`: finding contract, signal-collector,
  conformance F1–F3 floors, classifier, fragmentation symmetry, security/reliability/
  testability floors, policy-engine, baseline-ratchet, debt-registry+lifecycle,
  intentional-debt, fitness-registry). Project Map gains structural signals (fan-in/out,
  instability, blast-radius, co-change). Line count is now an **advisory** signal that
  never blocks CI/merge; the gate is the **sole CI verdict path** (mode active). Config
  `architectureDebtGate` + l5.lineBudget migration + doctor; constitution §1 amended
  across all sources with host parity. 35 §34 acceptance tests, §13 activation proofs,
  18-case calibration. Merged to main; dogfood active.
- **ARCH-DEBT floor calibration — F2/F3 lit (OP-0003, WF-0057, ADR-0122, card #370).**
  `resolveArchDebtConfig` now passes the conformance authorities (`layerRules` /
  `ownership` / `writeAuthorities`) through and supplies an empty-by-default
  `conformanceBaseline` when any is wired (null otherwise → floors stay SKIPPED, no
  protection gap); the gate composition root passes that baseline into `runGate`.
  F2 (boundary) + F3 (state-authority) now **EVALUATE** on the real tree instead of
  SKIP, block a genuine new violation, and pass clean. Schema models the four new
  keys; template seed ships a documented inert `_floorConfigExample`. New
  `selfcheck-arch-debt-calibration.mjs` (15 checks) + schema assertions. Semantic
  dimensions (cognitive-coherence, change-amplification) stay **OBSERVE_ONLY** — §33
  promotion declined for lack of graded-input evidence (constitution §8).
- **Economy canary guidance fingerprint (OP-0006/WF-0060).** Restored the
  `work-packet` token in the canary activation guidance so the
  `economyActivationSection` fingerprint passes (it was reworded to "bounded packet").
- **Workflow ownership enforcement (BIZ-0001 rule 3).** `createWaveWorkflow` now nests
  owned workflows under `operations/<OP>|business/<BIZ>/workflows/WF-<n>-<slug>` (throws
  if the owner folder is absent); `workflow.mjs new --profile` honors `--operation`;
  new `selfcheck-workflow-ownership.mjs` CI guard.
- **Ownership-based ADR filing (OP-0003, ADR-0123 Accepted).** New `decisions-file.mjs`
  files loose top-level ADRs by owner — Business/Operation attribution → their folder,
  ownerless → `legacy/` — dry-run by default (`--write` applies), with a path-reference
  audit and an idempotent, atomic move. Wired dry-run-safe / fail-open into the installer
  `--update` path (`tools/install/decisions-migrate.mjs`). Amends ADR-0102's
  "not migrated implicitly" layout policy. Dogfood migration filed 112 ADRs → `legacy/`
  and `0122` → `operations/`.
- **Antigravity Host Hook Parity (OP-0002, ADR-0121 Accepted, card 001).**
  Added `done-sweep.mjs` Stop hook to Antigravity's settings composer (`agent-hooks-compose.mjs`) when `level >= 5` to resolve the host parity gap.
- **WF0014 — MCP Integration Layer: governed MCP manager + read-only ContextDevKit MCP server (ADR-0073 Accepted, cards 186-197, merged to `main`).**
  ContextDevKit becomes the *governed layer* for MCP servers, never a bundle: a single
  curated registry under `templates/contextkit/mcp/` is the source of truth; zero-dep
  pure renderers emit native MCP config per host (Claude/Codex/Cursor/Antigravity);
  a policy engine enforces **R0–R5 risk**, read-only-by-default, least-privilege tool
  allowlists, secrets-by-reference, version pinning and provenance; `/mcp`
  (discover/add/profile/doctor/audit/sync/disable/receipt) is wired for claude +
  antigravity; and the kit exposes its own state as a **read-only stdio MCP server**
  (10 tools / 6 resources / 5 prompts). GitHub (read-only) and Playwright (guarded)
  least-privilege profiles ship as the first two. Receipts (MCP-010) degrade to
  `skipped` and governed write tools (MCP-011) to `deny+explain` until the
  capability-enforcement substrate (CDK-021/022) lands — never a false pass. The
  server stays off the Levels 1–3 boot/hot path (immutable rule 1). Every ticket ships
  behaviour + static-wiring suites (split into focused ≤270-line sub-suites).
- **Economy resource telemetry + auto-activation (OP-0001, ADR-0117 Accepted, extends ADR-0103).**
  A single shared telemetry seam (`economy/telemetry-emit.mjs` + `economy/registry.mjs`)
  routes every economy resource to the observed-savings ledger (the 4 levers only) or the
  lifecycle-events ledger, with a strict honesty fence (observed vs estimated never summed).
  The three dormant levers now light up: **project-map `--find` records an observed saving
  on a hit**; **run-compact records its saving** (fixed a CLI bug — the runner never passed
  `root`, so `logSavingSync` silently no-opped) **and emits an `evaluated` event at boot
  without spawning** (rule 2); **routing persists its lifecycle event** to the unified events
  ledger (the decision record carried it but it was never written there). A hardened
  multi-pattern secret redactor (`economy/redact.mjs`, 12 token classes) and a completeness
  meta-test (`selfcheck-economy-completeness.mjs`, registered in CI) guarantee no measurable
  lever ships dark and track the remaining advisory/lifecycle resources.
- **OP-0001 / WF-0039 — the three deferred economy work-packages shipped; completeness gate HARD 20/20.**
  All 13 remaining resources are now instrumented at honest points: 6 at genuinely-wired
  application sites (CLI mains + the `loop-breaker` PreToolUse hook + idempotent `context-profiles`
  in dev-start), and 7 dormant Phase-1/2 modules given **runnable CLI surfaces that emit on
  invocation, with no auto-hook** — new `economy/task-compiler.mjs` (read/compile-only ladder,
  `execute:false` so it never crosses the Task Compiler kill-criterion), new
  `economy/subagent-profile.mjs`, an `agent-contract` drift-audit CLI, and new
  `economy/lean-loop-cli.mjs` (the dormant modules keep their deferred-by-design guards). The
  completeness gate is now HARD for **all 20** resources, with a behavioral selfcheck
  (`selfcheck-economy-instrumentation.mjs`) proving every emit-site by ledger delta. **W7**:
  `run-compact` persists summary-only by default (full raw `output.log` behind `--capture-full`),
  routes every persisted byte through the 12-class redactor, `runs/` gitignored, torn-line
  safety proven. **W8** (`economy/kill-criterion.mjs`): per-lever kill-criterion meter,
  per-session audit line (`net` observed-only, `fable_auto:false`), and a separate `estimated`
  lane in `token-report` never folded into the observed headline.
- **WF-0041 — competitive follow-ups: claims gate + run-journal tail (ADR-0118, merged to `main`).**
  Retired the WF-0040 research spike (folder + COMP cards #225–#229) and migrated its two
  still-live recommendations under operation OP-0002: `claims-gate.mjs` (#354) — a fails-closed
  evidence-tier gate that refuses any public economic/autonomy/competitor claim lacking evidence
  IDs + a snapshot date (refuse-by-default, reuses the `claim:null` discipline) — and
  `runs.mjs --events <id> --follow` (#355) — a daemon-free tail of the append-only transition
  journal (ADR-0043), 500 ms poll with a clean SIGINT exit. Adds claims-gate + runs-follow
  selftests and a dedicated `integration-test-competitive-followups` suite. Zero hot-path deps.
- **Memory-reading reinforcement: `contextkit/memory/` is gitignored-by-design, never "ignorable".**
  Added a prominent callout to the boot context (`CLAUDE.md` template) and a line atop the
  boot-banner Process rules: memory/ is kept out of the PUBLIC repo on purpose (it syncs to the
  private mirror, never to a public push) but is the authoritative project record and must ALWAYS
  be read/searched. Fixes a recurring agent failure where "gitignored" was misread as "unimportant".
- **ADR-0078 & ADR-0079 accepted (status), kept PRIVATE.** Both are `Accepted`; they were briefly
  force-tracked onto `main` then **untracked** (`git rm --cached`) — ContextDevKit's own dev memory
  (`contextkit/`) stays out of the public repo and lives in the private mirror only. Public tracks 0
  `contextkit/` files.
- **Workflow creation requires an owner work-context (ADR-0116 Accepted, OP-0001).**
  `createWorkflow` / `workflow.mjs new` now refuse a `feature`/`architecture` workflow
  without an owner (`--operation OP-####` or `--business BIZ-####`), naming the
  corrective command and stamping `owner:` into the workflow index frontmatter;
  `bug`/`chore`/`spike` stay owner-optional. Closes the BIZ-0001 gap where an
  operation-class workflow could be created bare (ownerless) at the top level.
  Backed by a regression suite in `integration-test-workflow-governance.mjs`.
- **WF0016 — public/internal documentation projection boundary + business-driven README
  (merged to `main`, ADR-0075 Accepted).** Public docs (`README.md`, `docs/`, `instrucoes.md`)
  are now capability-only, enforced by a per-PR docs gate: `docs-public-lint` (banned decision-ids /
  inspiration names / internal paths, with code-block exemption), `readme-claims` (inventory-claim
  freshness), and `selfcheck-docs` + `integration-test-docs` (registered in the test suite). The
  README/instrucoes were restructured around a **business-driven** value proposition with an
  active-by-default / automatic / manual capability matrix. Added the `docs/architecture/` Diátaxis
  bucket, per-genre `_TEMPLATE.md`, and authored content: 2 tutorials, 8 how-to guides, 3 explanations
  (business-driven development, the three economies, governance & enforcement).
- **Automatic feature-reference generation + coverage gate (ADR-0115 Accepted).** `docs-generate.mjs`
  regenerates `docs/reference/{commands,agents,hosts}.md` from the canonical registry between markers
  (idempotent; `--check` is a CI staleness gate); `selfcheck-docs` blocks on a stale reference and
  reports prose-coverage debt as advisory. Wired into `docs-refresh`.
- **WF0038 A7–A9 (W5–W7) — automatic orchestration downstream of classification, shadow-first
  (branch `feat/wf0038-a7-a9`, ADR-0112 Accepted).** Re-homes the dropped A6/ADR-0110 design intent
  under WF0038. **A7** active governed context resolver (deterministic precedence → confirmed/
  suggested/ambiguous/unlinked; never hardcodes the root Business) + auto-deliberation (L7 debate-by-
  default gate, threshold 0.6, distinct synthesizer, recommend-only). **A8** per-tier over-orchestration
  guard (trivial 0 / feature ≤3 / architectural ≤5 sub-agents; debate floor wins) + explicit dispatch
  plan gated behind `executeDispatchPlan`+active mode + planned-vs-dispatched reconcile — extends the
  W1–W4 selector, no rebuild. **A9** child execution envelope (inherits root business/nature/ceremony/
  context/decisions/acceptance; flat delegation; `assertChildScope` refuses reclassify/autonomy-change/
  scope-expansion/createWorkflow/acceptADR) + lazy role-pack hydration under a HARD token budget +
  child→task→wave→business state propagation. 8 new runtime modules, all shadow-only, zero active
  dispatch; per-wave selfchecks W5 11/11 · W6 12/12 · W7 13/13; `selfcheck.mjs` 2252/2252; tech-debt
  no-RED across 695 files. **Merged to local `main` `14a42a0`** (not pushed) + **wired live**: A7+A8
  now enrich the envelope inside `orchestrate()` (run by the `UserPromptSubmit` hook on every plain
  prompt), shadow/fail-open. Post-merge fixes: A7 never convenes for trivial work (Gate 0) and
  auto-deliberation **defers to the classifier's `needsDebate`** (raw materiality is unreliable);
  structural triggers still escalate. End-to-end verified (new Business + new Operation, AI-cannot-
  self-approve enforced); QA sign-off PASS (118/118 suites, tech-debt 0 RED).
- **BIZ-0001 Business-Driven Development & Decision Governance — CLOSED as
  `partially-validated` (merge `2ae77bd`, local main, not pushed).** Final closeout
  adopted the remaining Session-4 waves — **A5** (investment-forecast + recurrence/
  outcomes), **B4** (legacy ADR indexing/migration dry-run + anti-redundancy +
  installer propagation), **B5** (program-governance validator) plus the §3
  routine-coverage split and 6 internal bug-fixes — while **dropping Wave A6**
  (duplicate of WF0038/ADR-0107; ADR-0110 stays superseded → ADR-0107). A 5-agent
  verification swarm confirmed each wave's acceptance; CI **119 suites green,
  tech-debt no-RED across 679 files**; WF-0036/WF-0037 advanced to `conclusion` via
  engine mutators; 3 registries (work-context, workflow, decision) rebuild
  byte-idempotent; ADR-0099 updater-safety + decision-coverage floors intact.
  Engineering outcomes measured-green; usage/adoption outcomes honestly `unknown`
  pending telemetry. [ADR-0102]
- **Automatic economy pipeline at `/dev-start` (WF0037) — merged to local main
  `7c0b3cf`, not pushed.** Deterministic objective fingerprinting, resume and
  Project Map probes before broad context, L7 RequestOrchestrator reuse,
  idempotent lifecycle events, correlated execution acknowledgements, honest
  routing/Token Report reconciliation, and generated Claude/Codex/Antigravity
  parity. Final CI: 113 suites, zero tech-debt RED; post-merge safe-update and
  dogfood smokes passed. Cards #347-350 concluded.
- **Session Autonomy Receipt (ADR-0108) — merged to local main `0874779`, not pushed.** Per-session
  auditable autonomy/token/cost receipt: an assembler over the existing economics layer (no new ledger)
  producing `cdk-autonomy-receipt/1` with a versioned estimator (measured / estimated /
  insufficient-evidence), token + executor accounting, financial (api/hybrid) with cost-source priority,
  Ed25519 integrity (node:crypto, hash-only fallback), mode-aware render, flat-ledger store, and an
  `autonomy-report` CLI. Advisory + fail-open. The WF0018 #242 pilot lives only in a SCOPED
  calibration-profile registry (claim null) — no global multiplier constant; subscription never invents
  savings; estimated is never relabeled measured. Hardened by a code-review (0 blockers) + a 3-voice
  debate (deliberation 2026-06-20-02). CI green: 112 suites + tech-debt no-RED; 96 dedicated checks.
  OPEN: distributed default `enabled:true` (spec §34) vs opt-in (debate voice C) — confirm before push.
- **WF0022 Phase 2 authorized by the project owner (ADR-0109).** After five consistent cross-stack
  A-vs-C measurements (arm-C cheaper at equal QA, CIs excluding 1.0×; formally unpowered, claim null),
  the owner authorized building Phase 2 (#276–280: deterministic transforms, scaffold, content cache,
  recipe-runner, ephemeral dispatch). ADR-0089 safety contract is now binding. A `PHASE2-EXECUTION-PROMPT.md`
  (cards/DAG, reuse list, swarm rules, multi-session coordination) drives execution. claim stays null —
  this authorizes the build, not a claim elevation.
- **Per-lever ablation benchmark harness (ADR-0106, WF0022 #275) — branch `feat/per-lever-benchmark`,
  not merged.** Registry-driven ablation-ladder matched-pair benchmark: `lever-registry` (8 active
  Phase-1 levers + 5 dormant Phase-2 endpoints), `ablation-plan` (fitToBudget to the $25 cap, never
  below 3 reps), `ablation-run` (symptom-only single-variable run-specs), `ablation-record` (JSONL +
  equal-QA matched pairs), `origemcrm-seed` (generic TS bug seeder), `phase2-evidence-spec` (§8
  firewall: unbuilt levers return `skipped`, never `pass`). All reuse `benchmark-statistics`/
  `baseline-harness` read-only; all ≤308 lines, zero-dep; selfcheck (40 asserts) wired; full CI green.
  A scaled powered run on a fresh kit-free origemcrm-test (TS/vitest) gave +12.3% aggregate, CI95%
  [1.024, 1.273] (excludes 1.0×), equal QA — but INCONCLUSIVE/unpowered, **claim null** (a human elevates).
- **Task Compiler execution ladder — Phase-1 Wave 1+2 (WF0022 #265/#267/#268/#270/#271/#272).** A
  read/compile-only deterministic ladder under `economy/`, composition-over-forking (reuses
  project-map, complexity-rubric, model-policy, the ADR-0083 envelope — nothing rebuilt):
  `tc-telemetry` (packet-cost/escalation telemetry), `tc-intent` (ambiguity scorer, escalate-by-default),
  `tc-related` (related-files + symbol projection + closure guard), `tc-route` (pure-fn execution-router),
  `tc-validate` (result-validator → envelope; prose rejected), `tc-accept` (conjunctive skip-aware
  accept-gate). Each ships a `runTc*Checks` runner aggregated in `selfcheck-economy-all`; all files
  ≤308 lines, zero-dep. Built via a governed 5-agent swarm; merged with full CI green (111 suites, 0 RED).
- **Task Compiler #275 wedge — INCONCLUSIVE verdict on existing data (claim null).** Matched-pair
  A-vs-C on the existing arm-A/arm-C2 measures (n=8, 1 rep): savings ratio median CI [1.039, 1.678]
  (excludes 1.0×), +39.8% aggregate, equal QA — but evidence tier `unpowered` ⇒ formal conclusion
  INCONCLUSIVE, claim stays null. Phase 2 (#276–280) remains blocked pending a powered (≥3-rep) run.
- **BIZ-0001 Business-driven methodology — Session 3 waves A3·B2·A4·B3 (ADR-0102).** Built as a
  5-agent swarm with intelligent model routing (Haiku ops · Sonnet exec · Opus design). A3:
  Business draft→approve→revise→reject lifecycle with a human-only approval ceremony (AI cannot
  self-approve), Business Gate (accepted-ADR + matching decisionHash) and a Growth validator
  (causal chain + KPI completeness + no invented baselines). B2: deterministic decision-need
  classifier + materiality score + existing-ADR search/match (no embeddings), attached additively
  to intake (`signals.decisionNeed`/`decisionMatch`, fail-open). A4: global cross-root workflow
  resolver (new + legacy) + collision detection + migration planning (dry-run by default,
  human-gated ownership transfer). B3: hook split (`execution-contract-advisory.mjs`) + approval
  mirroring/supersession + decision-coverage gates. New suites a3/b2/a4/b3-bdm.

### Fixed
- **MCP install propagation hotfix (WF-0061 / card 371).** The installer now
  copies `contextkit/mcp/` and `contextkit/mcp-server/` into fresh installs and
  update targets alongside runtime/tools, with a real install/update regression
  test proving the curated MCP registry, profiles, and read-only MCP server are
  installed without clobbering project-local MCP state.
- **done-sweep blind to wave-format workflows (ADR-0119 amendment).** The `done/`
  lifecycle sweep only recognised legacy `index.md` `conclusion: done`, so wave-engine
  workflows (completion recorded in `workflow-state.json` `overallStatus: done`) were
  never filed and business/operations `done/` archives stayed empty. `isConcluded()`
  now reads both, and the filing owner is recovered from the holder path when the wave
  index carries no `owner:`. Filed the concluded BIZ-0001 workflows (WF-0036/WF-0037).
- **BIZ-0001 a4 migration: `collisions is not iterable` on a clean checkout (ADR-0102).**
  `detectWorkflowCollisions()` returns `{duplicateIds, duplicatePaths}` but `migration-plan.mjs`
  iterated it as an array. Added `normalizeCollisions()` (object→array, no auto-move) + regression guard.
- **BIZ-0001 decision-bdm: clean-clone resilience (constitution §8).** The suite's ADR-0102 +
  live-registry checks now SKIP (not fail) when the gitignored dogfood decision tree is absent.
- **`defaults.mjs` over the 308-line budget.** Economy Phase-A activation had pushed it to 309
  (tech-debt RED). Extracted the `ledger` block into `defaults-ledger.mjs` (behavior identical).
- **`project-map --find` now covers UNEXPORTED symbols + deprioritizes test files (WF0018).**
  The dense index reused the export-only sampler, so unexported helpers returned 0 candidates and a
  `_test.go` could be the top hit. `project-map-dense.mjs` now uses a dedicated dense extractor
  (exported + unexported, all langs) and orders source files before test/spec files (`isTestFile`).
  compozy index 5228 → 11548 symbols; the symbols that the ceiling re-test flagged now resolve to
  their source file. selfcheck-projmap-find extended; CI green (lone decision-bdm env fixture aside).

### Added
- **Token report: "💸 Economy in effect" — OBSERVED per-lever savings (CDK-266).** New
  `economy/economy-savings.mjs` append-only ledger logs how many tokens each lever actually avoided
  in the user's own sessions: boot-delta (banner-size reduction every reboot) and run-compact (full
  output − compact summary) are wired and real; project-map + routing appear honestly as `0 (dormant)`
  until they actuate. The block is labelled "observed — NOT a causal claim vs no-kit (#243)" and carries
  NO claim field. Populates on the next session boot.
- **Token report: benchmark-pilot evidence surface (WF0018 #176/#242).** Reads
  `contextkit/memory/benchmark-pilot.json` and shows the measured A-vs-C pilot (1.398× / +39.8% token
  efficiency at equal correctness, n=8) with `claim: null` ALWAYS rendered (even if the file carried a
  claim) and the ADR-0080 #243 powered-run gate cited — a pilot signal can never read as a powered claim.
  #176 baseline + #242 pilot data marked obtained; #243/#245 stay gated.
- **Deterministic economy stack — `--find`, work-packet, auto-activation (WF0018/WF0022 #266, ADR-0103).**
  Five token-economy levers, ON by default and auto-emitted every session via the SessionStart banner
  ("💸 Economy mode active"): `project-map --dense` + `--find <symbol>` (complete symbol→file reverse
  index + 1-line query, a grep replacement); `tc-packet` work-packet compiler (the symbol SLICE
  `{file,symbols,lines}`, not the package — dry-run, claim/cost null; WF0022 #266 pulled forward);
  `economy-dispatch` (bundles the `subagent` context profile + `run-compact` + loop-breaker);
  `economy-session-activation` (emits the deterministic-tools guidance, wired into session-start +
  boot-banner). Reversible via `economy.autoActivate` / `economy.tools.*` (defaults-economy.mjs).
  6 selfchecks (63 asserts) via `selfcheck-economy-all.mjs`. Zero-dep, deterministic, all ≤308 lines.
  Ships in `templates/` → install + `--update` propagate it. Measured A-vs-C floor: +7.1% token
  efficiency at equal correctness on a 217k-LOC Go repo (claim:null).
- **Economy CEILING measured — full stack (`--find` + `run-compact` + work-packet) = +39.8% (WF0018).**
  arm-C2 on the same 8 compozy bugs, 8 Sonnet sub-agents, package given: Σ 0.223453 MTok vs reused
  arm-A 0.312447 (8/8 green both) → multiplier **1.398×**, beating the prior +7.1% floor by 30.6%.
  Wins concentrate on retry-heavy tasks (t7 −56.6%, t5 −40.4%). `claim:null` (n=8, 1 rep; caveat:
  parallel-tree contamination inflated t5/t6/t7 → conservative upper bound). Report under
  `contextkit/memory/workflows/0018-.../reports/2026-06-19-economy-retest-ceiling.md`.
- **Economy Dispatch Plan helper — advisory bundle for sub-agent spawning (feat/project-map-dense).**
  New `templates/contextkit/tools/scripts/economy/economy-dispatch.mjs` bundles the three
  advisory economy levers (context-profile subagent, run-compact hint, loop-breaker signal)
  into a single frozen `buildDispatchPlan()` plan object the orchestrator attaches when
  spawning a sub-task. Gracefully degrades if sibling modules fail to load; disabled via
  `cfg.economy.enabled=false`. `presentDispatchPlan()` emits a terse advisory string.
  Selfcheck module (`tools/selfcheck-economy-dispatch.mjs`, 14 asserts) confirmed green.
  Zero runtime deps, deterministic, pure, ≤308 lines. Advisory only — never blocks.
- **EACP Autonomy Multiplier — activated from the state substrate (ADR-0105, WF0018 #255).**
  The multiplier was wired but starved (token-report fed it no tasks → always "skipped").
  New `economics/autonomy-outcomes.mjs` derives `usefulAutonomy` records from the append-only
  pipeline state events (`actor:'qa'` deterministic-gate transitions — no parallel ledger, §9);
  token-report now feeds them. The numerator is MEASURED (advisory; dogfood lit up at 17/17
  QA-green); the causal ratio still degrades to "skipped" until a kit-free baseline arm-A (#176).
  `claim:null` throughout. Ships in `templates/` → propagates to existing installs on `--update`.
- **EACP subscription-mode benchmark — measure tasks-per-window without API spend (ADR-0104, WF0018 #254).**
  New `economics/benchmark-subscription.mjs`: an A-vs-C Autonomy-Multiplier pilot denominated by an
  OBSERVABLE usage unit (effective-MTok primary, quota-% corroboration) instead of USD, so
  subscription-host users (e.g. Claude Code Max) can run it through the CLI with no API key and no
  metered spend. `claim:null`; single-session runs flagged `pilotSmoke` (arm A not isolated). The
  USD/API path (#242/#243) is unchanged and remains the authority for the dollar claim.
- **Economy Runtime activation go-live — advisory, ON by default (ADR-0103, WF0020).**
  Activates all 9 previously-dormant Economy Runtime modules ON by default (advisory,
  fail-open) in the dogfood and in every new/updated install: a per-module toggle
  surface (`ECONOMY_MODULE_KEYS` single source → `FLAG_DEFAULTS`, `EconomySchema`,
  `defaults-economy.mjs` seed), installer additive distribution + a go-live notice,
  patch-economy (#263) + loop-breaker (#262) warn-only advisories on the CDK-032 gate
  (`gate-advisory.mjs`; pure `evaluateAction` untouched), the canonical Output Contract
  injected into all 12 qa-* agents + run-compact/lean-loop notes in commands, and
  boot-delta (#259) gating of unchanged informational boot sections (`boot-delta-gate.mjs`;
  −49.8% on re-boot, Process rules + drift never gated). Disable per-module via
  `economy.<module>.enabled=false` or wholesale via `economy.enabled=false`; `economy.mode`
  stays advisory (never blocks). Install/update bug-hunt clean; CI green.
- **Business-Driven Methodology program — BIZ-0001, Wave A0 (WF-0036 + WF-0037, ADR-0102).**
  Bootstrap of a business-driven, evidence-governed methodology: one approved Business
  (TRANSFORMATION / PLATFORM_CAPABILITY) with two nested Workflows — A (Business/Operations/
  Workflow architecture) and B (Authoritative Decision Governance) — over one shared domain
  model. Wave A0 (documentation/contracts only) materialized in an isolated worktree:
  canonical Business package (business-case/growth/investment/business.json), shared entity &
  identifier contracts, source-of-truth + ownership/origin rules, schema & compatibility plans,
  cross-workflow dependency DAG, §40 agent-dispatch contract (per-task agent type, allowed/
  forbidden paths, evidence, expected-result JSON), both workflow packs, and the primary
  Business ADR-0102 (accepted, YAML front matter v2) under a new `decisions/{business,
  operations,legacy}/` layout. **Hybrid format ruling**: new dash-prefixed IDs + dirs + YAML
  for new artifacts; legacy `NNNN-slug` workflows + plain-markdown ADRs preserved, resolvable,
  never migrated implicitly. Planning/dogfood only — no runtime code yet; pacing capped at
  4 waves/session; next is Wave A1 (paths + schemas + Operations + registries).
- **Economy Runtime Wave 1 — output/lifecycle actuation (WF0020, ADR-0082..0086, ECON-01..07/11).**
  Eight advisory, fail-open, UNREGISTERED libraries under `tools/scripts/economy/` that
  bound output, tool cost, preparation, and context lifetime by governing artifacts the
  kit already owns — no new gate, no command-file edits: output contract + worker
  envelope (override floor + evidence-preservation invariant), findings protocol +
  deterministic merge, single-source agent output contract, compact command runner
  (exit-code truth + normalized delta), context-pack `digestUnreleased` parity + profiles,
  boot delta (lib), `ship-state checkpoint` + bounded resume-pack, and `economy.*`
  governance with honest before/after measurement. 57 econCheck assertions aggregated
  into `selfcheck-economy-wave1`.
- **Economy Runtime Wave 2 — advisory gate signals (WF0020, ADR-0082/0084, ECON-08/09/10).**
  Three gate-coupled libs that COMPUTE `projectState`-compatible signals for WF0019's CDK-032
  `evaluateAction` WITHOUT a new gate and WITHOUT touching the live gate (wiring deferred):
  lean-loop (delegate-to-worker, controller-scoped to `/ship`/`/swarm`, with the worker-envelope
  contract), loop-breaker (repeat-error / repeat-diff / no-progress detection; escalates only at
  `strict` + self-clearing), and patch-economy (suggest Edit/patch over Write-rewrite of a large
  file). All advisory + fail-open + UNREGISTERED. 30 econCheck assertions in
  `selfcheck-economy-wave2`. **Completes WF0020 (all 11 cards, workflow `done`).**
- **Activation go-live — advisory enforcement stack + installer policy distribution (ADR-0097, WF0032).**
  Wires the built-but-dormant PKG-04 advisory hooks into `settings-compose` at L≥5
  (completion-gate, subagent-gate, compaction-continuity — all warn-only, fail-open;
  `enforcement.mode` stays advisory). `/state` now surfaces a Fleet/Agents headline at
  L≥7. New `tools/install/policy-migrate.mjs` additively distributes policy-store keys
  on `--update` (reusing the config-migration semantics; user values always win;
  `capability-registry.json` now seeded). `enforcement.mode` is NOT raised to guarded
  (still gated on dogfood thresholds).
- **Capability Enforcement PKG-08 — Fleet & Agent platform (CDK-080…083, WF0031, ADR-0072 + ADR-0096).**
  The FINAL package — the program is now 50/50 complete. Three advisory, read-only,
  fail-open, UNREGISTERED tools that compose the PKG-04…07 surface (§9): `fleet-compliance`
  (fleet-wide capability-compliance + scorecard + readiness roll-up across registered
  repos), `agent-registry` (unified roster+squad+tier+quality index; per-agent cost
  surfaced honestly as `null` until the usage-event schema can attribute it), and
  `policy-distribution` (advisory dry-run additive diff of kit-baseline vs target policy
  stores; installer wiring deferred). New ADR-0096 records the Agent Forge/Fleet product
  boundary (Forge internal, Fleet local, distribution = propose-review). Covered by
  `selfcheck-pkg08-fleet.mjs` (23 checks). `npm run ci` green: 72 suites, tech-debt 0 RED.
  Local-only on `main`, not yet released.
- **Installer config-section auto-migration on `--update` (ADR-0095, workflow 0030).**
  `npx contextdevkit --update` now additively merges new default config sections
  (e.g. the `routing:` block) into an existing project's saved `config.json`,
  preserving every user override; idempotent, arrays treated as leaves. New pure
  module `tools/install/config-migrate.mjs` (`migrateConfigSections`) wired into
  `engine.mjs writeConfig`, plus a version-aware `📦 Updated vX → vY` notice in
  `install.mjs`. Covered by `integration-test-config-migrate.mjs` (28 assertions,
  `integration:installer` tier). **Shipped in product release v3.0.0** — consolidated
  PKG-05..07 + EACP Waves 1–8 + ADR-0094 routing onto `main` (PR #96), published to
  npm with provenance + GitHub Release.
- **Capability Enforcement PKG-07 — lineage consumers (CDK-071…077, WF0029, ADR-0072).**
  Seven read-only advisory consumers of the CDK-070 lineage graph: public ADR
  projection (`lineage-public`), lineage calibration (`lineage-calibration`),
  executable business rules (`lineage-rules`), governance policy index
  (`policy-registry`), canonical evidence taxonomy (`evidence-taxonomy`),
  engineering scorecard (`engineering-scorecard`), and autonomy-readiness v2
  (`autonomy-readiness-v2`). Each composes existing signals — no new state, zero
  writes to any source store, fail-open, UNREGISTERED, every file ≤ 280 lines.
  PKG-00…07 complete (program 42/50). Local-only.
- **Automatic model routing for standard sessions (ADR-0094).** Persistent,
  default-on routing posture — *Haiku operates · Sonnet executes · Opus decides*
  (Opus implements high/critical-risk code directly; Fable never auto-selected) —
  active in **every** session, not just `/swarm`, with **no re-prompting**. Composes
  the ADR-0052 engine (`model-policy.mjs`) + EACP economics; does not fork them. New
  `tools/scripts/routing/`: `task-classifier.mjs` (deterministic complexity×risk→
  executor), `routing-decision.mjs` (runner-first over-orchestration guard +
  total-cost estimate via `cost-engine`), `routing-config.mjs` (precedence
  session>project>default + activation), `routing-telemetry.mjs` (append-only
  decision ledger; kit-routing economics only — never the provider's cache savings).
  New `routing:` config block (`defaults-routing.mjs` + zod `RoutingSchema`) defaults
  to **`shadow`** mode (recommend + measure only; `canary`/`active` are deliberate,
  telemetry-gated promotions). SessionStart persists `ledger.routing{active,mode}` and
  surfaces one short boot-banner line; `/dev-start` + `/log-session` carry the posture
  (deterministic collection → runner/Haiku). `/token-report` gains an additive
  `routingTelemetry` surface. Tests: `selfcheck-routing.mjs` (42 checks, floor→1480) +
  `integration-test-routing.mjs` (20 acceptance scenarios); `npm run ci` green
  (63 suites + tech-debt 0 RED / 375 files). Disable per session via `routing.enabled=false`.
- **EACP Wave 7 — #176 benchmark baseline harness + ADR-0080/0081 ratification (WF0018).** Seventh EACP wave; baseline scaffold (claim null, data pending a real run).
- **EACP Wave 6 — benchmark pilot harness (WF0018, card #242 EACP-13). Sixth EACP wave.**
  Read/scaffold-first A/B/C benchmark harness model — `economics/benchmark-design.mjs`
  (arms A/B/C, `PILOT_ARMS` `['A','C']`, controls-held-equal, task strata, phases,
  targets {1.30/1.50/1.70} — targets, not claims), `benchmark-run.mjs` (deterministic
  `MOCK_PROVIDER`, no spend; runs degrade to `skipped` without a provider/baseline;
  append-only JSONL), `benchmark-report.mjs` (independent-QA scoring with
  evaluator≠operator gate, matched-pair `comparePilot`, advisory `presentBenchmark`).
  **Honesty-gated**: the #176/CDK-003 baseline is unbuilt, so every real-measurement
  path returns `skipped`/`unknown` and `claim` is ALWAYS null (ADR-0080 evidence tier).
  Mock runs are labeled and excluded from claims; zero-dep + deterministic. New
  `selfcheck-eacp-benchmark.mjs` (7th EACP runner) + integration smoke; `npm run ci`
  green (60 suites + 0 RED). Awaiting human merge/commit on `main`.
- **Capability Enforcement PKG-06 — multi-host telemetry, compliance, benchmark & drift (split wave, WF0027, ADR-0072, cards 314–318).**
  Five advisory, additive, zero-dep, UNREGISTERED deliverables on branch `feat/pkg06-multihost-telemetry` (`7a526ea`, awaiting human merge; `npm run ci` green — 57 suites + tech-debt 0 RED / 330 files):
  `skill-runner.mjs` (CDK-060, resolve/list Claude native skills), `capability-compliance.mjs` (CDK-061, per-host compliance matrix),
  `telemetry/normalize.mjs`+`adapters/codex.mjs` (CDK-062, host→adapter dispatch that *consumes* the EACP usage-event — zero writes under `economics/`),
  `benchmark-task.mjs` (CDK-065, continuous tokens-per-completed-task ledger), `wiring-drift.mjs` (CDK-068, instruction/config/wiring drift guard).
  The 4 cost cards (CDK-063/064/066/067) are deferred behind the EACP economics merge (consume, don't fork).
- **Capability Enforcement PKG-06 cost consumers — per-host cost, capability ROI, cache-churn health (WF0027, ADR-0072, cards 314–316).**
  Three advisory, additive, UNREGISTERED consumers of the EACP `economics/` layer (merged to local main `51f078d`; `npm run ci` green — 60 suites + tech-debt 0 RED / 350 files; zero writes under `economics/`):
  `host-cost.mjs` (CDK-063, per-host financial cost + gross cache value over multi-host telemetry that claude-only token-report-cost can't see),
  `capability-roi.mjs`+`-core` (CDK-066, NEW `byCapability` attribution lens joining `attributionSkill`→registry `aliases.claude`, then cost),
  `cache-churn-health.mjs` (CDK-067, correlates wiring-drift churn with cost-engine gross cache value into a cache-health band).
  **CDK-064 (context pressure & re-read) dropped** as superseded by EACP Wave 3 report-advisories (constitution §9 — no speculative half). PKG-06 now complete (9/9); program at 34/50.
- **Capability Enforcement PKG-05 — project-map & adaptive context (WF0026, ADR-0072, cards 307–313).**
  Seven advisory, additive, zero-dep deliverables (merged to local main 718fc3b; npm run ci green — 52 suites + 0 RED):
  - **#307 CDK-050** — configurable project-map `roots`/`excludes` with a two-tier
    (deep vs root-anchored) exclude model; `contextkit` is now root-anchored, fixing
    the dogfood self-map so `templates/contextkit` (the source) is mapped.
  - **#308 CDK-051** — read-only project-map coverage report (`/project-map --coverage`).
  - **#309 CDK-052** — deterministic, metadata-only executable context manifest tool
    (`context-manifest.mjs`); boot-hook injection deferred to a user-gated activation.
  - **#310 CDK-053** — playbooks scoped by workflow phase / squad (`playbook list --phase/--squad`).
  - **#311 CDK-054** — zero-dep BM25 lexical retrieval ranking (`memory-score.mjs`);
    `memory-retrieve` swap deferred.
  - **#312 CDK-055** — rule fossilization ledger for deprecated/superseded rules.
  - **#313 CDK-056** — multi-host selective context-load parity check (claude/codex/agy; 0 real gaps).
- **EACP Wave 1 — economic measurement core (WF0018, ADR-0078/0081).** First
  implemented slice of the Economic & Autonomy Control Plane: a zero-hot-path-dep
  `templates/contextkit/tools/scripts/economics/` module cluster.
  - **#230 EACP-01** — canonical `UsageEvent` (`usage-event.mjs` +
    `usage-buckets.mjs`): schema versioning, bucket-close invariant
    (`total = freshInput + output + cacheRead + cacheWrite + reasoning`),
    fail-fast `normalizeEvent`, and `toDelta` delta/cumulative normalization that
    structurally prevents summing cumulative totals as deltas. Five confidence-rated
    attribution lenses (`attribution-lenses.mjs`: inclusive/byAgent/byModel/byPhase/
    exclusiveBySkill) and a Claude Code usage adapter (`adapters/claude-code.mjs`)
    that declares its capabilities and fakes no missing data.
  - **#231 EACP-02** — privacy & retention foundation (`privacy.mjs` +
    `retention.mjs`): local-first, metadata-only defaults, opt-out / external-send
    consent gates (default off), deterministic path redaction, fail-closed
    retention/purge, provenance stamping, and a `skipped`-not-passed marker.
  - **#232 EACP-03** — sanitized synthetic fixtures + golden outputs reproducing a
    cache-heavy session SHAPE and proving the cumulative-summing trap is neutralized
    (naive 74,125 → normalized 19,545). Fixtures prove pipeline correctness only,
    not baseline reality (panel QA#11).
  - Coverage: new `tools/selfcheck-eacp.mjs` (33 assertions, wired into
    `selfcheck.mjs`) + 3 end-to-end assertions in `integration-test-token-economy.mjs`.
    Advisory/measurement-only; no command behavior changed; ADRs remain Proposed
    (ratified by EACP-17). Token report v2, cost engine, pressure, budgets,
    benchmark are later waves.
- **EACP Wave 2 — pricing registry & cost semantics (WF0018, ADR-0079).** Second
  slice of the Economic & Autonomy Control Plane: offline, reproducible cost on top
  of the Wave 1 measurement spine. Zero-hot-path-dep; ≤308 lines/file; npm run ci
  green (52 suites + 0 RED). Advisory/measurement-only; ADR-0079 remains Proposed.
  - **#233 EACP-04** — versioned pricing registry (`economics/pricing/`):
    offline JSON snapshot with full provenance (source, fetchedAt/verifiedAt,
    effectiveDate, confidence, deprecation, context window) and **TTL-aware cache
    prices (cache-read + cache-write by 5m/1h)** — the forge capability-matrix
    (illustrative, input/output only) is *not* the cost source. Loader API
    (`pricing-registry.mjs`): `loadRegistry` (null when absent, throws when
    malformed-present), `priceFor`/`resolveModelId` (alias-tolerant),
    `isPriceUsable` (gates `inferred`/`unknown` out of dollar figures),
    `detectDrift`, `registrySummary`, private-override merge, thin CLI. Fable-5
    ($10/$50) ships `confidence: inferred` → renders `unknown`, never a price.
  - **#234 EACP-05** — cost engine (`cost-engine.mjs`): `actualCost` (cache-write
    at its real TTL multiplier, cache-read ≈0.1×), `noCacheCost`, `grossCacheValue`
    (labeled *provider feature, NOT kit contribution*), `routingSavings`
    (quality-gated), `costPerQaGreenTask`, and `projectTierCost` — which finally
    **wires the previously-unused `model-policy.priceForTier`** (matrix-derived →
    honestly `inferred`). **E2 open decision pinned to variant (b)** — no-cache =
    `(fresh+cacheRead+cacheWrite)×input + output×output` — frozen in
    `fixtures/cost-golden.json` (the only variant that yields a positive gross
    cache value). Missing/inferred price → `usd:null` + `confidence:unknown`,
    never `$0`; subscription hosts never lead with USD.
  - **#235 EACP-06** — Token Report v2 (`token-report-cost.mjs` + additive
    `token-report.mjs`): `--json` now carries `schemaVersion: eacp-token-report/2`
    and a `financial` block (per-model + total actual cost, gross cache value,
    confidence tier, unpriced-model disclosure) — strictly additive, every legacy
    key preserved. Registry absent → `skipped`, never fabricated cost.
  - Coverage: new `tools/selfcheck-eacp-cost.mjs` (21 assertions, wired into
    `selfcheck.mjs`; MIN_CHECKS floor raised) + 3 registry→cost→Report-v2
    end-to-end assertions in `integration-test-token-economy.mjs`.

- **EACP Wave 3 — session pressure & context-health advisories (WF0018,
  ADR-0077/0081).** Third slice (v1-wedge §D): the two cheapest, highest-salience
  advisories on top of the Wave 1 measurement spine. Advisory-only, additive,
  zero-hot-path-dep; ≤308 lines/file; `npm run ci` green (52 suites + 0 RED).
  ADR-0077/0081 remain Proposed.
  - **#236 EACP-07** — session-pressure score + split (`economics/session-pressure.mjs`):
    `deriveSignals` (turns, mean tokens/turn, cache-write ratio, total — observed
    cache-read/turn kept unscored) → `pressureScore` weighted over present signals
    only → band `healthy|elevated|hot|critical` with `splitRecommended` +
    actionable recommendations + triggers. Thresholds are **ADR-0077 policy data**
    (frozen table). Neither totalTokens nor turns present → `skipped`, never a
    false `healthy` band.
  - **#237 EACP-08** — repeated-read + map effectiveness (`economics/map-effectiveness.mjs`):
    `readFacts` over normalized tool-call **metadata** (never message content) →
    observed repeated-read counts, broad-searches-before-map, files-opened-after-map,
    project-map ROI framing. **Paths redacted** (`[8hex]/basename`, ADR-0081);
    deterministic ordering; empty events → `skipped`, never fabricated facts.
  - Surfaced via Token Report v2 (`economics/report-advisories.mjs` seam +
    additive `pressure` / `mapEffectiveness` keys on `token-report --json` and
    two table lines) — `schemaVersion` stays `eacp-token-report/2`, every legacy
    key preserved.
  - Coverage: new `tools/selfcheck-eacp-pressure.mjs` (36 assertions, wired into
    `selfcheck.mjs`; MIN_CHECKS 1225→1265) + Wave 3 end-to-end advisory assertions
    in `integration-test-token-economy.mjs`.

- **EACP Wave 4 — budgets/cost-guards & model-routing economics (WF0018,
  ADR-0045/0052/0077).** Fourth slice (§E + §F): the economic controls that ride
  the *existing* governance seams — no new enforcement path. Advisory-only,
  additive, zero-hot-path-dep; ≤308 lines/file; `npm run ci` green (57 suites +
  0 RED / 345 files). ADRs remain Proposed (ratification is #246).
  - **#238 EACP-09** — budgets & cost guards (`economics/budgets.mjs` engine +
    `economics/budgets-report.mjs` surface): `evaluateBudget` over 13 scopes
    (call…provider) maps spend→limit into the mode ladder
    `observe→warn→ask→downgrade→split→block`, then escalates to `split` under
    Wave-3 `hot`/`critical` pressure and clamps to the budget's `ceilingMode`.
    Its only enforcement coupling is the plain `budgetExhausted` boolean the
    **existing** autonomy resolver already consumes at grade 4 (ADR-0044 D3) —
    it imports nothing from `resolve-autonomy.mjs` and is **not** a new gate.
    `recommendCheaperModel` never drops below `policy.floorTier` on a critical
    task; `applyBypass` records human-bypass provenance and **refuses** a bypass
    without `by`/`reason`; every evaluation carries an `auditRecord` (timestamp
    caller-supplied — deterministic). Missing budget / spend / over-limit-with-no-
    hardCap all degrade to `skipped`, never a false "within budget".
  - **#239 EACP-10** — model-routing economics + Fable audit
    (`economics/routing-economics.mjs`): `routingFactors`/`selectStrategy` weigh
    task/complexity/risk/privacy/budget/tool-calling into one of seven strategies
    (fixed/fallback/cost-/latency-optimized/quality-evaluated/local-first/
    privacy-constrained); `routingROI` counts savings **only at equivalent
    quality** (null + `unknown` confidence when QA signals are absent — never a
    fabricated number); `fableAudit` documents Fable-5 ($10/$50 MTok, premium,
    manual-only, `accidentalRisk` flag for any auto-route). `tierEconomics`
    finally wires the previously-unused `model-policy.priceForTier` (through
    `cost-engine.projectTierCost`), degrading to `skipped` when the forge matrix
    is absent.
  - Surfaced via Token Report v2 (additive `budgetGuard` / `routing` keys on
    `token-report --json` + two table lines) — `schemaVersion` stays
    `eacp-token-report/2`, every legacy key preserved; the report stays
    grade-blind (display only, never calls the resolver).
- **EACP Wave 5 — quota snapshots & the Autonomy Multiplier (WF0018,
  ADR-0080/0081).** Fifth slice (§G autonomy intelligence): the
  outcome-based measurement of how much *useful* autonomy the kit buys per unit
  of (mostly unobservable) host quota. Advisory-only, additive, zero-hot-path-dep;
  ≤308 lines/file; `npm run ci` green (57 suites + 0 RED / 349 files). ADRs remain
  Proposed (ratification is #246).
  - **#240 EACP-11** — append-only quota snapshots
    (`economics/quota-snapshots.mjs`): `buildSnapshot` records host · plan ·
    window type/start · reset · remaining/used % · capture method · confidence.
    Most hosts expose no quota API, so capture is manual → confidence `inferred`,
    and a missing percentage degrades to `null` + `unknown` — **never a fabricated
    number** (constitution §8). Persisted as JSONL under the existing state
    substrate (`contextkit/memory/quota-snapshots.jsonl`) via `appendSnapshot`
    (the lone mutator; refuses to persist a `skipped` marker); `readSnapshots` is
    defensive, `quotaSummary`/`latestPerHost` collapse to the latest per host.
    Local-first, metadata-only, no PII.
  - **#241 EACP-12** — Autonomy Multiplier
    (`economics/autonomy-multiplier.mjs`): `(QA-green tasks per quota unit with
    the kit) ÷ (baseline)`. When quota is unobservable, explicit substitutes
    (`api-usd` / `effective-mtok` / `hour` / `host-snapshot`), one primary fixed
    per host. The numerator is **Goodhart-guarded**: `usefulAutonomy` counts a
    task only when acceptance is met + tests run + QA green + no critical bypass +
    no immediate rollback + no material-error reopen + (any human intervention
    logged) — never raw actions/turns/files; `usefulReasons`/`countUseful` keep
    the exclusions transparent. Targets `1.30×` pilot / `1.50×` product / `1.70×`
    potential surface as **targets, never claims** — `claim` is hardcoded `null`
    until the #242 benchmark proves it; confidence is `derived` on quota,
    `inferred` on a substitute, and the whole ratio degrades to `skipped` without
    a baseline (never a false multiplier).
  - Surfaced via Token Report v2 (additive `quota` / `autonomy` keys on
    `token-report --json` + two table lines) — `schemaVersion` stays
    `eacp-token-report/2`; both honestly degrade to `skipped` in the live report
    (transcripts carry no quota or QA-green signal). Test wiring: new
    `selfcheck-eacp-autonomy.mjs` + the EACP selfcheck runners refactored behind a
    single `selfcheck-eacp-all.mjs` aggregator (kept `selfcheck.mjs` under the
    line budget) + Wave-5 assertions in `integration-test-token-economy.mjs`.
  - Coverage: new `tools/selfcheck-eacp-budget.mjs` + `tools/selfcheck-eacp-routing.mjs`
    (43 assertions, wired into `selfcheck.mjs`; MIN_CHECKS 1265→1308) + Wave 4
    budget→resolver-path and quality-gated-ROI assertions in
    `integration-test-token-economy.mjs`.

- **Stack-aware QA scaffolding** — new `scaffold-tests.mjs` command maps
  Node/JavaScript, Python, Go, Rust, and PHP projects into happy/edge/failure
  QA cases and can create starter harness tests with explicit `--write`.
  `/test-plan`, `/scaffold-tests`, and `qa-orchestrator` now start from this
  deterministic stack map before specialist delegation.

- **Active Squad Posture Gates** — Added `squads` metadata to session ledgers to track active postures and squads. Optimized compliance path audit checks by checking specific session files instead of walking all sessions, preventing directory re-read performance bottlenecks and union-leakage security bugs. Added integration tests covering compliance posture gating.

- **Active squad posture activation** - `squad.mjs activate <intent-or-path>`
  now records detected postures in the active session ledger, and the L5 guard
  audits only the target path it is checking. This prevents unrelated modified
  gated files from leaking into a guarded edit decision.

- **Automatic docs refresh** - `docs-refresh.mjs` regenerates the Diataxis
  docs index during pre-commit, and client `--update` refreshes
  `contextkit/README.md` through the manifest-safe update path.

- **Planning packs for four initiatives (no code; session 75)** — four workflow
  spec-packs + umbrella ADRs (Proposed) + roadmap milestones + 39 DevPipeline cards,
  all deferred behind the Capability Enforcement program: MCP Integration Layer
  (wf 0013 / ADR-0073 / P6 / cards 186–197), Cursor as 4th native host
  (wf 0014 / ADR-0074 / P7 / cards 198–206), docs public/internal projection
  restructure (wf 0015 / ADR-0075 / P8 / cards 207–214), and OpenCode as 5th native
  host (wf 0016 / ADR-0076 / P9 / cards 215–224). Three deliberations recorded
  (2026-06-14-01/02/03). `deliberations.active` made explicit in `config.json`.

## [3.1.2] - 2026-06-17

### Updater-safety hotfix (ADR-0099, WF0034)

Bounded hotfix making `node install.mjs --update` incapable of silently
destroying session or user state. A dogfood revealed that an `--update` restarts
the host, fires `SessionStart`, and its 15-minute temporal heuristic deleted
recently-resolved peer ledgers from the board. The larger transactional updater
(full journal, resumable updates, rollback engine, BASE/MINE/THEIRS blob store,
semantic merge, ownership registry, layout-migration registry) is deferred to
**3.2.0** by design — see ADR-0099 for the scope boundary.

#### Fixed
- **P0-01** — `SessionStart` never deletes ledgers: removed the `rm()` reap from
  `session-start.mjs`. Registered/resolved/concurrent ledgers survive host
  restarts (the incident's proximate cause). Drift detection is preserved.
- **P0-05** — `atomicWriteIfChanged`: `.claude/settings.json` is written via
  atomic tmp+rename and only when content changed (no `mtime` churn / watcher
  trips), and is committed late in the update sequence.
- **P0-06** — `.engine-version` is stamped LAST (only on final success), so the
  prior version remains on any earlier failure.
- **P0-07** — honest non-TTY conflict status: unresolved conflicts preserve both
  sides (kit copy stashed under `contextkit/.updates/`) and report
  `UPDATED_WITH_PENDING_MERGES` instead of a clean success.
- Config `installedAt` no longer re-stamps on every `--update` before setup
  completes (config.json is now byte-idempotent across repeated updates).

#### Added
- **P0-02 / P0-03** — update preflight guards: `--update` defers with
  `DEFERRED_ACTIVE_SESSIONS` (active sessions) or `DEFERRED_SELF_UPDATE`
  (updating the kit's own source repo) and makes ZERO writes, unless overridden
  with `--allow-active-sessions` / `--allow-self-update` (both required when both
  risks apply — one consent never implies the other).
- **P0-04** — external critical-state snapshot under
  `~/.contextdevkit/projects/<id>/backups/<update-id>/` (hashed + verified, never
  inside the repo) taken before the first mutation; aborts with `FAILED_SNAPSHOT`
  on a verification failure.
- **P0-09** — the project-map baseline (WF0033) defers generation while sessions
  are active or on a self-update, and never regenerates an existing map.
- Honest update statuses (`UPDATED` / `UPDATED_WITH_PENDING_MERGES` /
  `DEFERRED_*` / `FAILED_*`) and corrected user-facing docs: `--update` "never
  modifies user-authored memory (ADRs, sessions, roadmap, business rules, project
  docs)"; derived artifacts like the project-map may be refreshed when safe.

#### Compatibility
- **P0-08** — VibeKit backward compatibility is unchanged and now regression
  -locked: only-`vibekit/` migrates (user data byte-for-byte), only-`contextkit/`
  no-ops, a hybrid tree is detected + preserved + reported (no destructive
  resolution), legacy config paths migrate by allowlist only, historical prose is
  never globally rewritten, and a second migration run is idempotent.

## [3.1.1] - 2026-06-16

Hotfix release on top of the 3.1.0 feature merges. Closes two defects found in
the public `3.0.0`: a P0 config corruption during `--update`, and the HIGH gap
where automatic routing was a
library but never wired into real prompts. No breaking changes; drop-in upgrade.

### Fixed

- **P0 — `--update` could corrupt `config.json` path lists.** The v3.0.0
  installer's path-migration healer treated the first segment of ANY
  non-resolving path as a legacy platform prefix, accepted an empty suffix
  (`dist/` → `contextkit/`), and adopted the rewrite merely because `contextkit/`
  exists on disk after install. *Symptom:* legitimate lists such as
  `["src/","lib/","node_modules/","dist/","build/","coverage/"]` collapsed into
  duplicate `["contextkit/", …]` entries ("migrated N config path(s) onto
  contextkit/"). *Fix:* migration is now allowlist-gated — it rewrites only a
  KNOWN legacy prefix (`vibekit`, single-sourced from the installer's rename map),
  never an empty suffix, only when the rewritten target resolves on disk, and
  never touches globs, URLs, absolute, Windows or variable paths; order-preserving
  and idempotent. `config.json` is now written atomically (tmp + rename, never
  partial) and only when changed, backing up to `config.json.bak` before any
  legacy-path repair. *Compatibility:* fully backward compatible; a clean v3.0.0
  config is left byte-identical. *Rollback:* revert to 3.0.0 (re-introduces the
  bug); no data migration needed. (`tools/install/config-paths.mjs`, `engine.mjs`,
  `fs.mjs`)
- **P0 — recovery for already-affected installs.** `/context-doctor` now detects
  the collapse signature and a new `contextkit/tools/scripts/config-health.mjs`
  diagnoses + safely recovers: states `healthy / suspected_corruption / repairable
  / manual_repair_required / repaired / skipped`, `--json` output, dry-run by
  default. It NEVER invents values — the collapsed strings are unrecoverable from
  the file, so an ambiguous case is `manual_repair_required`; deterministic
  recovery is offered only from a healthy `config.json.bak` and only after
  re-verifying the restored config is itself clean, preserving the corrupted file
  as `config.json.corrupt` evidence.
- **HIGH — automatic routing now runs on real prompts.** In v3.0.0 the ADR-0094
  routing modules (classifier, decision, telemetry) were reachable only from tests
  and the boot banner: the real `UserPromptSubmit` hook built an Execution Contract
  but never classified the prompt, decided a route, or wrote
  `routing-decisions.jsonl` — so `shadow` observed nothing and `/token-report` had
  no data. *Fix:* a thin orchestrator (`runtime/execution/routing-runtime.mjs`)
  composes the canonical modules and the hook now records a real decision per task
  prompt and surfaces the recommendation on the contract. *Host limitation
  (honest by design, ADR-0094 §Decision):* no host can switch the current session's
  model from a hook, so a decision's `applied` is always `false` with an explicit
  reason (`shadow_mode` / `host_does_not_support_in_session_model_switch` / …);
  `recommendedTier`, `selectedTier` and `actualTier` are distinct, no economy is
  ever claimed while `applied=false`, and the full prompt is fingerprinted, never
  stored. Decisions are idempotent per `(session, prompt-fingerprint, policy)` and
  telemetry failure is fail-open (never blocks the prompt).

## [3.1.0] - 2026-06-16

Feature merges into `main` after 3.0.0, shipped together under this minor. All
additive, advisory and fail-open — no breaking changes.

### Added

- **Capability Enforcement PKG-08 — fleet & agent platform (CDK-080..083,
  ADR-0072, WF0031).** The final capability package: fleet-wide compliance
  reporting (`fleet-compliance.mjs`), an agent registry (`agent-registry.mjs`),
  and the cross-repo platform read consumed by `/state` and `/fleet`. Advisory,
  UNREGISTERED by default.
- **PKG-04 go-live — advisory hooks + `/state` fleet read + installer policy
  distribution (ADR-0097).** Activates the PKG-04 advisory hooks, surfaces a fleet
  read in `/state`, and distributes policy on install/update via
  `tools/install/policy-migrate.mjs` + `policy-distribution.mjs` (additive,
  user-overrides preserved).
- **Economy Runtime — WF0020 Waves 1 & 2 (ECON-01..11).** Output/lifecycle
  actuation and advisory gate signals: output contracts, run-compaction,
  resume packs, lean-loop, loop-breaker, patch-economy and findings-merge under
  `templates/contextkit/tools/scripts/economy/`. Advisory + controller-scoped;
  rides the existing WF0019 guard (no new gate).

## [3.0.0] - 2026-06-16

Version 3.0 is the major consolidation release for ContextDevKit's intelligence
layer. It closes out the full **Capability Enforcement program** (PKG-05..07,
CDK-050..077), ships the **Economic & Autonomy Control Plane** (EACP, WF0018)
measurement plane across eight waves, and introduces **automatic per-session
model routing** (ADR-0094) in `shadow` mode — recommend-and-measure-only, never
blocking. The release also ships installer config-section auto-migration on
`--update` (ADR-0095) so existing projects gain new default config blocks without
losing user overrides.

### Added

- **Capability Enforcement PKG-05 — project-map & adaptive context (CDK-050..056,
  WF0026, ADR-0072).** Seven advisory, additive, zero-dep deliverables: configurable
  project-map `roots`/`excludes` with a two-tier exclude model (CDK-050), read-only
  coverage report (CDK-051), deterministic executable context manifest tool
  (CDK-052, boot-hook injection deferred), playbooks scoped by workflow phase/squad
  (CDK-053), zero-dep BM25 lexical retrieval ranking (CDK-054), rule fossilization
  ledger for deprecated rules (CDK-055), and multi-host selective context-load parity
  check across Claude/Codex/agy (CDK-056). All fail-open, UNREGISTERED.

- **Capability Enforcement PKG-06 — multi-host telemetry, compliance, benchmark &
  drift (CDK-060..068, WF0027, ADR-0072).** Nine advisory consumers: native-skill
  resolver (CDK-060), per-host compliance matrix (CDK-061), host telemetry adapter
  consuming EACP usage-events with zero writes under `economics/` (CDK-062),
  per-host financial cost + gross-cache-value report (CDK-063), capability ROI lens
  joining `attributionSkill` → registry aliases → cost (CDK-066), cache-churn health
  correlating wiring-drift with gross cache value (CDK-067), continuous
  tokens-per-completed-task ledger (CDK-065), and wiring-drift guard (CDK-068). All
  zero-dep, UNREGISTERED, fail-open.

- **Capability Enforcement PKG-07 — lineage graph + seven consumers (CDK-070..077,
  WF0029, ADR-0072).** CDK-070 provides the canonical lineage graph; CDK-071..077
  are seven read-only advisory consumers: public ADR projection (`lineage-public`),
  lineage calibration (`lineage-calibration`), executable business rules
  (`lineage-rules`), governance policy index (`policy-registry`), canonical evidence
  taxonomy (`evidence-taxonomy`), engineering scorecard (`engineering-scorecard`),
  and autonomy-readiness v2 (`autonomy-readiness-v2`). Each composes existing signals
  with no new state and zero writes to any source store. Completes the 42/50
  Capability Enforcement program. All UNREGISTERED, fail-open.

- **EACP Wave 1 — economic measurement core (WF0018, ADR-0078/0081).** Zero-hot-path
  `economics/` module cluster: canonical `UsageEvent` schema with bucket-close
  invariant and `toDelta` normalization preventing cumulative-summing errors
  (EACP-01); privacy/retention foundation with local-first, metadata-only defaults
  and opt-out consent gates (EACP-02); sanitized synthetic fixtures proving the
  normalization pipeline (EACP-03). Advisory/measurement-only.

- **EACP Wave 2 — pricing registry & cost semantics (WF0018, ADR-0079).** Versioned
  offline pricing registry with TTL-aware cache prices and confidence tiers
  (EACP-04); cost engine covering actual cost, no-cache cost, gross cache value
  (labeled "provider feature, NOT kit contribution"), routing savings quality-gated,
  and cost-per-QA-green-task (EACP-05); Token Report v2 with additive `financial`
  block — registry absent degrades to `skipped`, never fabricated (EACP-06).

- **EACP Wave 3 — session pressure & context-health advisories (WF0018, ADR-0077/0081).**
  Session-pressure score + band (`healthy|elevated|hot|critical`) with `splitRecommended`
  and actionable recommendations; absent signals degrade to `skipped`, never false
  `healthy` (EACP-07). Repeated-read and map-effectiveness analysis over metadata
  only, paths redacted (EACP-08). Both surfaced via additive Token Report v2 keys.

- **EACP Wave 4 — budgets/cost-guards & model-routing economics (WF0018, ADR-0045/0052/0077).**
  Budget engine evaluating 13 scopes into a `observe→warn→ask→downgrade→split→block`
  mode ladder; its only enforcement coupling is the existing `budgetExhausted` boolean
  the autonomy resolver already consumes (EACP-09). Model-routing economics with
  quality-gated `routingROI` — null + `unknown` confidence when QA signals are absent,
  never a fabricated number — and `fableAudit` documenting the manual-only Fable-5
  premium path (EACP-10). Surfaced via additive Token Report v2 keys.

- **EACP Wave 5 — quota snapshots & the Autonomy Multiplier (WF0018, ADR-0080/0081).**
  Append-only quota snapshots with confidence tiers; most hosts expose no quota API so
  capture is `inferred`, missing percentage degrades to `null` + `unknown` — never
  fabricated (EACP-11). Autonomy Multiplier: `(QA-green tasks per quota unit with
  kit) ÷ (baseline)`, Goodhart-guarded against raw action counts; targets 1.30×/1.50×/
  1.70× are stated as targets only, `claim` is hardcoded `null` until the benchmark
  proves it (EACP-12).

- **EACP Wave 6 — benchmark pilot harness (WF0018, ADR-0080, card #242).** A/B/C
  benchmark harness scaffold (`benchmark-design.mjs`, `benchmark-run.mjs`,
  `benchmark-report.mjs`) with deterministic mock provider, append-only JSONL, and
  independent-QA scoring with evaluator-≠-operator gate. Honesty-gated: the #176/
  CDK-003 baseline is unbuilt, so every real-measurement path returns `skipped`/
  `unknown` and `claim` is always `null` (ADR-0080 evidence tier). Mock runs are
  labeled and excluded from claims.

- **EACP Wave 7 — benchmark baseline harness + ADR-0080/0081 ratification (WF0018).**
  Baseline scaffold extending Wave 6; baseline data pending a real run — claim remains
  null.

- **EACP Wave 8 — routing economics wiring (WF0018).** Final EACP wave wiring
  routing economics into the measurement spine; all ADRs ratified.

- **Automatic model routing for standard sessions (ADR-0094).** Persistent,
  default-on routing posture — Haiku operates, Sonnet executes, Opus decides — active
  in every session (not just `/swarm`), with no re-prompting. New
  `tools/scripts/routing/` module cluster: deterministic `task-classifier.mjs`
  (complexity × risk → executor tier), `routing-decision.mjs` (runner-first
  over-orchestration guard + cost estimate), `routing-config.mjs` (session > project
  > default precedence), `routing-telemetry.mjs` (append-only decision ledger,
  kit-routing economics only — never the provider's cache savings). New `routing:`
  config block defaults to **`shadow`** mode (recommend + measure only;
  `canary`/`active` are deliberate, telemetry-gated promotions). `/token-report`
  gains an additive `routingTelemetry` surface. Fable-5 is never auto-selected.

- **Installer config-section auto-migration on `--update` (ADR-0095).** `npx
  contextdevkit --update` now additively merges new default config sections (e.g. the
  `routing:` block) into an existing project's saved `config.json`, preserving every
  user override; idempotent across runs. A version-aware "Updated vX → vY" notice is
  shown on each successful migration.

### Changed

- **Test suite coverage expanded.** New `selfcheck-routing.mjs` (42 checks, floor
  raised to 1480+) and `integration-test-routing.mjs` (20 acceptance scenarios);
  seven EACP selfcheck runners aggregated behind `selfcheck-eacp-all.mjs` to keep
  `selfcheck.mjs` under the line budget. `npm run ci` green at 63 suites + tech-debt
  0 RED / 375 files.

## [2.8.0] - 2026-06-15

The **Capability Enforcement program** (PKG-01..04, ADR-0072) lands as an
advisory, fail-open, *dormant* substrate, and the kit's own test harness is
re-architected for fast, agent-friendly execution (**WF0024**, ADR-0093). 39
commits since 2.7.0. Every enforcement unit is inert below L5, never blocks in
advisory mode, is fail-open, and ships UNREGISTERED — activation is a deliberate
separate step.

### Added

#### Capability Enforcement — substrate & gates (ADR-0072, advisory & dormant)
- **CDK-020** — canonical capability registry + pure deterministic resolver.
- **CDK-021** — task intake + deterministic execution contract (requiredBefore exploration / write / completion); hermetic intake tests.
- **CDK-022** — tamper-resistant, fingerprinted, metadata-only receipt store.
- **CDK-023** — advisory / guarded / strict enforcement modes + audited bypass (incl. the Grade-4 human floor); ships `advisory` by default.
- **CDK-030** — Mandatory Execution Protocol atop the boot context of all 3 hosts (CLAUDE / Codex `AGENTS` / Antigravity `INSTRUCTIONS`).
- **CDK-031** — `UserPromptSubmit` hook classifies each request and records its execution contract.
- **CDK-032 / 033** — unified `PreToolUse` gate (pure `evaluateAction()`) warns on workflow-before-write + exploration-budget gaps; advisory wrapper.
- **CDK-034 / 035** — indirect-write reconciliation (Bash / formatter / MCP) + persisted broad-search (explore-budget) counter.
- **CDK-040** — completion-evidence `Stop` gate (`completion-gate.mjs` + pure `evaluateCompletion()`): warns when receipts for `requiredBeforeCompletion` are missing; trusts receipts only (anti-theatre — prose never satisfies it); ledger round-trips `activeTask` / `taskCounter` / `completionWarnedAt`.
- **CDK-041** — subagent governance (`subagent-gate.mjs`: `Task` PreToolUse + `SubagentStop` records the declared touch-set, warns on out-of-scope / forbidden writes). v1 limit: spawn counter is last-spawn-wins per task.
- **CDK-042** — compaction continuity (`PreCompact` persists a metadata-only record; `SessionStart` re-surfaces still-outstanding contract obligations).
- **CDK-043** — read-only compliance status-line segment (satisfied / missing completion evidence for the active task).

#### Test execution architecture (WF0024 / ADR-0093) — the kit's own dev harness
- **TEA-001 / 002** — single `tools/test-suites.mjs` registry + `tools/run-suites.mjs`; layered `test:smoke | unit | selfcheck | integration:{core,installer,hosts,workflow,enforcement,ecosystem} | full`. `npm test` behavior **preserved** (full, serial, fail-fast).
- **TEA-003** — compact agent-friendly reporter (one line per suite; failures first; full logs to gitignored `runs/`) + `selfcheck` quiet-on-pass (a count line vs 660+ lines; `--verbose` restores; failures always full).
- **TEA-004** — conservative `test:impact` selector: changed-files × `touches[]` map; false-negative-averse (unmapped path / missing Project Map / config-core / test-infra ⇒ full); explains every include/exclude. Hermetic self-test via an injectable Project-Map signal.
- **TEA-005** — `ci:fast` (PR, single Node, docs/planning path-filtered) / `ci:full` (Node 18/20/22, mandatory before publish, never selector-gated) split; `npm run ci` = `ci:full`.
- **TEA-006** — per-run duration-history telemetry (p50/p95, selection reasons, OBSERVED/DERIVED-tagged), append-only + gitignored; feeds the P10/P11 reports.
- **TEA-007** — README test-scripts table, CONTRIBUTING test-workflow section, `instrucoes.md` pt-BR summary, and the CI `test-fast` / `test` job split.

#### Install & config hardening (PKG-01)
- **CDK-013** — per-section strict config validation that preserves unknown fields.
- **CDK-014** — explicit local-only vs tracked install modes (onboarding guidance, installer banner, `context-doctor` install-mode inspection).

### Fixed
- **CDK-010** — Agent Forge optional-`yaml` test stages the dependency into its fixture so both the yaml-present and yaml-absent branches are exercised.
- **CDK-011** — removed the `git.mjs` ↔ `exclude.mjs` ESM import cycle via a shared `git-paths.mjs`; moved the gitdir-retarget invariant there and wired the install-cycle test into CI.

### Changed
- **CDK-012** — disambiguated the product changelog from the installed-project changelog, guarded by a selfcheck.

## [2.7.0] - 2026-06-13

Governance the engine enforces — three systems that move enforcement from prompt
to code: the **ContextKit parity import** (8 features), the **auto-invoked
deliberation council**, and the **workflow journey gate** (ADR-0060 → ADR-0071).
README restructured around the new arc; four new Diátaxis explanation docs added
under `docs/explanation/`.

### Added — ContextKit parity import (8 features, ADR-0060 → ADR-0068)
- **Auto-format hook (F1, ADR-0061).** A PostToolUse `auto-format.mjs` runs the
  project's formatter/linter right after each Edit/Write at level ≥ 4 (advisory —
  it auto-fixes when a toolchain is present and always exits 0; "skipped" when
  none is found). Wired across all three hosts (Claude/Antigravity/Codex).
- **Multi-language pre-push quality gates (F2, ADR-0062).** `quality-gates.mjs`
  detects the stack (10 languages + generic) and runs lint/format/typecheck/
  build/test, scoped to the monorepo packages a push touches. Warn-first: silent
  below `minLevel`, warn in `minLevel..strictLevel`, blocks at `strictLevel`; a
  missing tool is skipped, never a false failure. Runs from `pre-push` after the
  conflict pre-check. Bypass: `CONTEXT_SKIP_QGATES=1`.
- **Hook-manager coexistence (F3, ADR-0063).** Install detects an existing hook
  manager (husky / simple-git-hooks / custom `core.hooksPath`) and suggests a
  non-destructive integration path instead of silently running side-by-side.
- **CI Squad action (F5, ADR-0064).** An opt-in GitHub Action turns a
  `squad-ready`-labelled issue into a DRAFT PR via the headless pipeline. Ships
  out of the default tree — installed only with `--ci-squad` (or the interactive
  prompt); needs the `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` repo secret.
- **Standards promotion threshold (F7, ADR-0065).** `/distill-sessions` only
  proposes a new CLAUDE.md rule once a pattern has ≥3 evidenced occurrences;
  `/retro` deprecates superseded rules by strikethrough rather than deletion.
- **`/context-budget` skill + `@`-imports (F6, ADR-0066).** Read-only guidance on
  which context to load per task type (always / on-demand / skip); lightweight
  `@`-imports in `CLAUDE.md.tpl` keep the constitution lean.
- **Marker-based idempotent injection (F4, ADR-0067).** `marker-inject.mjs` owns a
  region between `<!-- ContextDevKit:start/end -->`, preserving the user's content
  around it and staying byte-idempotent across re-installs (the F8 enabler).
- **Multi-platform context bridges (F8, ADR-0068).** Opt-in (`bridges.enabled`)
  context bridges for six more tools — Cursor, GitHub Copilot, Gemini, Windsurf,
  Aider, Continue — written idempotently via marker-inject. These receive the
  CONTEXT layer ONLY; governance enforcement stays on the three native hosts.

### Added - workflow journey gate + numbering + branch-scoped guard (ADR-0071)
- **The `/workflow` journey is now enforced in the engine.** `advance` refuses to
  leave a phase whose deliverables are missing (empty PRD/SPEC, no ADR link, no
  card, no report) and lists the gaps; `--force` is the explicit override, and a
  new `workflow check <id>` reports readiness. Because it lives in the engine
  (`workflow-gate.mjs`), every CLI — Claude, Codex, Gemini — is held to the same bar.
- **Workflows are numbered like ADRs (`NNNN-slug`).** `createWorkflow` stamps the
  next number; `packDir` resolves a workflow by slug OR number; `renumberByStarted`
  migrates existing workflows by start date (oldest = 0001), idempotently, and
  `install.mjs` runs it on fresh + `--update` so installed projects renumber on update.
- **The L5 mutation guard is branch-scoped.** A pre-ship workflow now blocks edits
  only on its own branch (recorded at creation), so a parallel session/worktree no
  longer blocks unrelated work. Covered by `integration-test-workflow-governance.mjs`.

### Added - auto-invoked deliberation gates + tiered specialist council (ADR-0070)
- **Deliberation is now auto-invoked, not manual-only.** Two new autonomy areas
  (`feature-deliberation`, `decision-deliberation`) resolve to `debate` mode at
  grade ≥ 3, so starting a new feature (`/workflow` spec phase) or recording an
  architectural decision (`/new-adr`) auto-convenes a council. The ADR write itself
  stays `manual` at every grade — the deliberation precedes it, never authorizes it.
- **Dynamic specialist council.** New `deliberation-council.mjs` deterministically
  selects a relevant, named specialist roster (architect/security/ux-designer/…) by
  classifying the question into advisor lanes, scaling the count to
  `clamp(matchedLanes, council.min, council.max)` instead of a fixed 3 generic voices.
- **Tiered research swarm.** `/debate` now gathers evidence with cheap `fast`-tier
  (Haiku) scouts before the `reasoning`-tier (Opus) voices argue, with `powerful`-tier
  (Sonnet) verification for hard claims; voices and the synthesizer are never
  downgraded (ADR-0052). Models resolve through `model-policy.mjs`.
- **Broadened nudge + new config.** The `deliberation-nudge` hook also fires on a new
  ADR write; the `deliberations` config gains `council`, `autoInvoke`, and `research`
  blocks. Covered by `integration-test-deliberation.mjs` (20 checks) + selfcheck gates.

## [2.6.3] - 2026-06-13

### Fixed
- **Active squad posture gate:** Persist active squads in the session ledger,
  expose `/squad activate`, and scope `squad-audit` to the target path passed by
  `guard.mjs` so unrelated modified high-risk files no longer leak into the
  current edit decision.
- **Session-start robustness:** Split squad-context boot rendering into a small
  helper so the hook stays under the project file-size budget while preserving
  fail-silent behavior.

## [2.6.2] - 2026-06-13

### Fixed
- **Hooks:** Fixed a ReferenceError in the `session-start.mjs` hook where `resolve` was used without being imported from `node:path`.

## [2.6.1] - 2026-06-13

### Added - active agent squads integration
- **Active Agent Squads orchestration layer.** Introduced deterministic routing (`squads-registry.json` + `/squad route`), stack-aware playbook templates for all 8 squads under `workflows/playbooks/squads/`, and compliance/security auditing via `squad-audit.mjs` and `squad-director.mjs`.
- **Pre-commit L5 Gating.** Hooked the compliance auditor directly into the pre-commit `guard.mjs` gate to block unauthorized edits to L5 high-risk paths without posture activation.

### Changed
- **Docs refresh is now automatic for dogfood and client updates.** The Level 3
  pre-commit hook runs `docs-refresh.mjs` to regenerate `docs/README.md`, and
  `--update` now refreshes `contextkit/README.md` through the conflict-safe
  manifest path while preserving personalized client edits.

## [2.6.0] - 2026-06-13

### Added - stack-aware QA scaffolding
- **`scaffold-tests.mjs`** — a zero-dependency QA planner/scaffolder for
  Node/JavaScript, Python, Go, Rust, and PHP projects. `plan` reports detected
  stacks, runner/framework signals, and happy/edge/failure QA cases; `scaffold`
  is dry-run by default and creates only missing starter harness tests with
  explicit `--write`.
- **QA squad routing now starts from real stack context.** `/test-plan`,
  `/scaffold-tests`, and `qa-orchestrator` run the deterministic stack map before
  delegating to qa-unit, qa-integration, qa-fuzzer, qa-e2e, or qa-perf.
- **Coverage for the new QA tooling.** `integration-test-tooling-qa.mjs` installs
  a fixture with Node, Python, Go, Rust, and PHP manifests, verifies detection,
  proves dry-run-by-default behavior, and checks explicit scaffold writes.

### Changed
- README, architecture, levels, roadmap, and pt-BR usage docs now document the
  stack-aware QA flow and the v2.6 release posture.

## [2.5.0] - 2026-06-12

### Changed - default autonomy grade 3 + grade-4 informed consent (ADR-0058)
- **Default autonomy grade is now 3 (was 2).** Every fresh install lets the AI
  edit, test and move pipeline cards without asking out of the box; ADRs,
  pushes, secrets and high-risk paths still come to you (the floor is unchanged).
  Single-sourced in `defaults.mjs`, `schema.mjs` and the `resolveAutonomy`
  absent-grade fallback; onboarding now pre-selects grade 3.
- **Grade-4 eligibility bar drops the `rollback < 10%` criterion.** A `qa` bounce
  is the QA gate working, not an autonomy failure — counting it penalised honest
  QA use. The bar keeps five objective criteria (≥30 transitions · ≥20 sessions ·
  zero wiring-drift · self-coverage green · attribution present).
- **Grade-4 activation is now explicit informed consent.** `/autonomy 4` shows a
  disclaimer spelling out exactly what grade 4 grants and what stays human, then
  the human signs (`--confirm` is the [y] signature; omitting it is [n]/cancel).
- **No change to swarm or routing.** ADR-0052 model routing is grade-blind;
  ADR-0051 swarm already runs at grade 3 with one human OK per run (kept).

## [2.4.1] - 2026-06-12

### Fixed - workflow report defensiveness (ADR-0057 remediation)
- **No more false-pass on missing git.** `workflow report` now probes
  `git rev-parse --is-inside-work-tree` and writes an explicit
  `SKIPPED: git unavailable / not a repository` Diff summary instead of the old
  "No working tree diff." (which read a missing-git failure as a clean pass —
  violating ADR-0057 decision #7 and the "validators throw, not warn" rule).
- **Report concern split out.** Git + report logic moved from `workflow-pack.mjs`
  (was at the 280-line ceiling) into a new `workflow-report.mjs`; `workflow.mjs`
  stays the thin CLI wrapper. Both files now well under budget.
- **Defensive guards.** `git` spawns carry a timeout; a same-day report refuses
  to overwrite a filled `## Verification` without `--force`; a malformed
  `index.md`/breadcrumb is an explicit refusal naming the path (and a
  `skipped (malformed)` line in `status`/`list`), never silently treated as
  absent; frontmatter parsing tolerates CRLF.

### Fixed - Codex converter fidelity (ADR-0056 remediation)
- **Skill descriptions are adapted.** The Claude→Codex converter now runs skill
  `description` through `adaptContent` (was emitting raw "scoped CLAUDE.md" /
  "Claude Code token usage" text into Codex skills).
- **Correct skill path rewrite.** `.claude/commands/<x>.md` now rewrites to
  `.agents/skills/source-command-<x>/SKILL.md` (the real install layout) instead
  of a dead flat `.agents/skills/<x>.md` reference.
- **CRLF + host skip-list.** `stripFrontmatter` tolerates CRLF; a narrow,
  documented skip-list (`claude-md`, `token-report`, `fable`) keeps host-
  inappropriate skills out of the Codex surface (74 emitted, 3 skipped).
- **Property-based selfcheck.** `selfcheck-codex.mjs` now asserts output
  PROPERTIES (no Claude-only string in any description, no dead skill paths,
  skip-list honored, adversarial CRLF/quote/backslash/no-frontmatter inputs) —
  not generator-echo parity, which could never catch a conversion bug.

### Fixed - swarm planner reads explicit touch-sets (ADR-0051)
- **`listTasks` surfaces `paths:`.** The swarm planner reads `task.paths` to honor
  an explicit `paths:` frontmatter touch-set, but `listTasks` dropped the field —
  leaving that branch dead via the CLI. Added the passthrough so a card can pin
  its own disjoint touch-set for `/swarm`.

### Changed
- **Test split (RED-zone fix).** `integration-test-tooling-pipeline.mjs` (328
  lines, over the 308 hard block) split by responsibility — the ADR-0015
  execution-substrate suite moves to a new `integration-test-pipeline-substrate.mjs`
  sibling; both files are back under budget and `npm run ci` is green again.

## [2.4.0] - 2026-06-12

### Added - cost-tiered model routing Phase 2 (ADR-0052)
- **Deterministic model resolver.** `contextkit/tools/scripts/model-policy.mjs`
  turns the ADR-0052 tier table into an executable decision: `resolve --agent`
  (the `/ship` path) and `tier` (the `/swarm` path, which plans by `tierHint`).
  Order is contractual — task-class (`execute` → cheap) → QA escalation
  (`--qa-failures 2`, one tier up, capped at reasoning) → budget de-escalation
  (`--budget-exhausted`, one tier down) → **floor last** (security / code-security
  / infra-security / privacy-lgpd never below `powerful`). Price enrichment reuses
  the agent-forge matrix via an optional dynamic import, degrading to "no price"
  when the matrix is absent (L<4 / non-Claude host) rather than failing.
- **Policy materialized + drift-locked.** `contextkit/policy/routing-policy.json`
  mirrors the ADR table; `tools/selfcheck-model-policy.mjs` asserts it agrees,
  agent-by-agent, with the host-enforced `model:` frontmatter across all 34
  agents — a tier can no longer drift between the ADR, the policy and the agent
  files without a red gate.
- **Per-model attribution (`byModel`).** `token-report`/`token-attribution` now
  split spend by `message.model` ("Spend by model"), and the swarm manifest
  records the resolved alias per workstream with a `models:` breakdown in the run
  report — a fan-out's true tier mix is auditable, not assumed.
- **Resolve, don't eyeball.** `/ship` and `/swarm` now call `model-policy.mjs`
  before each dispatch and pass the returned alias to the Agent tool; omitting
  `model` silently inherits the premium session model — the costly default.

## [2.3.0] - 2026-06-12

### Added - workflow spec packs and completion reports (ADR-0057)
- **Workflow spec packs.** `/workflow` now creates
  `contextkit/memory/workflows/<slug>/` with `index.md`, `prd.md`, `spec.md`,
  ADR/task indexes, durable workflow memory, and dated reports. Legacy
  `memory/workflows/<slug>.md` breadcrumbs remain readable for status and
  advance.
- **Workflow reports + DevPipeline links.** `workflow.mjs report <slug>
  [--task <id>]` records branch, commit, `git diff --stat`, `--numstat`, touched
  files including untracked files, verification, and notes without duplicating
  full patches. Pipeline cards can now carry `workflow`, `spec`, `implemented`,
  and `concluded` metadata; moving to `testing` stamps `implemented`, while QA
  sign-off remains the governed path into `conclusion`.
- **Docs and coverage.** `/workflow`, `/pipeline`, `/dev-start`, `/log-session`,
  README/instrucoes, installer seeds, selfchecks, and integration tests were
  updated for the lifecycle `intake -> prd -> spec -> adr -> roadmap(if feature)
  -> pipeline -> ship -> testing -> conclusion`.

### Added - Codex native host parity
- **Codex joins Claude Code and Antigravity as a native host.** The installer now
  writes `AGENTS.md`, `.codex/hooks.json`, `.codex/agents/*.toml`, generated
  `source-command-*` skills under `.agents/skills/`, and a `cdx.mjs` runner
  mirroring `ctx.mjs`. Dogfood excludes now cover `.codex/`, `AGENTS.md`, and
  `cdx.mjs`, while doctor/context-level/selfcheck/integration tests guard the
  new host surface.
- **Codex now carries the full session discipline, not just generated assets.**
  Codex hooks identify themselves with `--host codex`, SessionStart pins a stable
  Codex ledger when no `session_id` is available, `AGENTS.md` includes the same
  workflow/constitution as the other hosts, and the docs state that Codex,
  Claude Code, and Antigravity cooperate over shared claims, ADRs, pipeline
  cards, sessions, and changelog.

### Added — `/fable`, the manual premium tier (ADR-0052 Phase 2)
- **`/fable <task>`** runs ONE task on **Claude Fable 5** — the premium model the
  automatic tier ladder never reaches (ADR-0052 caps auto-escalation at `opus`;
  Fable is the manual hatch *above* the ceiling). **Manual-only by construction:**
  no agent may declare `model: fable` (the selfcheck `VALID_MODEL_ALIASES` forbids
  it), and nothing auto-routes there — Fable runs only on an explicit `/fable`.
  It dispatches to a **subagent** with `model: fable` (premium runs in the
  subagent, never the main loop — the cache-safe ADR-0052 invariant), echoes the
  cost once, scopes to the one task, then returns to the normal tiers; the autonomy
  floor (ADR-0042) is unchanged (more capability, not more consent). Antigravity
  skill mirror generated; covered by selfcheck (command present + the manual-only /
  subagent-dispatch / cache-safe contract).

## [2.2.0] - 2026-06-12

### Added — deterministic QA sign-off + the grade-4 coverage gap closed (ADR-0055)
- **`pipeline.mjs qa-approve <id> --evidence "…"`** — the QA half of ADR-0043's
  sign-off doctrine finally has a verb: the ONLY testing→conclusion path besides
  the human `move`. Refuses without evidence, outside `testing`, or when the
  card's acceptance criteria aren't ≥1 checked / 0 unchecked; records the
  evidence on the card (`## QA Sign-off`) and in the event log (actor `qa`,
  `endedAt` stamped). `auto` stays fenced from `conclusion` at every grade.
- **`/pipetest [ids|--all]`** — run the project suite; green ⇒ `qa-approve`
  every complete testing card with the run summary as evidence; red ⇒ report,
  bouncing (`qa-reject`) only attributable failures — a global red never
  mass-bounces the lane. Swarm runs never call it; it's the human's closing
  move after `/swarm review`.
- **`integration-test-hooks.mjs`** — rule 2 as a test: every module under
  `runtime/hooks/` is executed twice (benign payload + garbage stdin) and must
  exit 0 in a bare project. Closes the grade-4 self-coverage gap (the bar's
  harness now sees every hook entrypoint exercised at its template path).

### Added — swarm coordinator v1 implemented (ADR-0051 accepted, task 123)
- **ADR-0051 flipped Proposed → Accepted** and shipped end-to-end: `/swarm`
  skill (plan·run·review·clean) + pure `swarm-plan.mjs` planner (WSJF rank;
  touch-set derivation card-`paths:` → simulate receipt → title inference;
  refusals for no-touch-set / secret floor / un-receipted l5 paths; greedy
  disjoint partition; hard cap 5 above config) + `swarm-state.mjs` manifest
  (`.claude/.swarm/<runId>.json`, atomic writes, append-only per-workstream
  history, stale eviction preserving worktrees, budget-park path) +
  `worktree-new.mjs --swarm <runId> <taskId>` mode (branch
  `swarm/<runId>/<taskId>`).
- **`swarm-dispatch` consent area** in `resolveAutonomy`
  (`[manual,manual,suggest,auto]`, budget-downgrade aware) and the optional
  `by: {runId, workstream, agent}` attribution field on state.json events
  (unknown keys dropped; plain events untouched). `swarm.*` config block
  (maxWorkstreams/maxWavesPerRun/tokenBudgetPerRun/staleMinutes),
  zod-modeled.
- **P0 validation run executed first** (the ADR's precondition): tasks 141+143
  fixed in parallel worktrees on sonnet/haiku tiers (ADR-0052), 52–61K subagent
  tokens each, 0/2 cross-workstream conflicts; branches parked at testing for
  human merge. Its load-bearing finding — rule 3 makes every workstream spill
  into shared TEST shards — is encoded in the planner as `TEST_HOME_RULES`
  touch-set expansion (test-asserted).
- **23-check `integration-test-swarm.mjs`** added to the npm test chain;
  selfcheck inventories the new scripts + skill; agy mirrors regenerated
  (the skill is documented; agy still runs its session model — the ADR-0052
  host gap stands).

### Added — dogfood-by-default install + conflict-safe 3-way update (ADR-0054, PR #77)
- **Dogfood by default.** The installer writes a managed BEGIN/END block to
  `<common-git-dir>/info/exclude` covering every generated artifact
  (`contextkit/`, `.claude/`, `CLAUDE.md`, `docs/CHANGELOG.md`, the Antigravity
  host, scaffolded `.github` files): fresh installs leave ZERO tracked kit files
  and `--update` stops flooding the target project's history. `info/exclude`
  only affects untracked paths, so it is unconditionally safe for projects that
  already commit the kit (they get opt-in `git rm -r --cached` guidance; the
  index is never touched — rule 8). Opt out with `--tracked`.
- **Conflict-safe update.** `contextkit/.install-manifest.json` (sha256 baseline
  of every kit-written file) drives a 3-way merge on `--update`: personalized
  files are kept silently when the kit didn't move; a real divergence prompts on
  a TTY ([b]oth/[r]eplace/[k]eep) and defaults to "both" headless, stashing the
  kit version under `contextkit/.updates/` — no side is ever lost. Manifest-less
  legacy installs refuse to clobber; user-created agents/commands are untouched.
- New sibling suite `tools/integration-test-update-safety.mjs` (21 checks) wired
  into `npm test`.

### Added — encoding + config-rot prevention guards (cards 144–145, PR #78)
- **Tree-wide mojibake gate** — `tools/selfcheck-encoding.mjs` scans
  `templates/`, `docs/`, `tools/` and the root docs for UTF-8-read-as-cp1252
  fingerprints (the PowerShell 5.1 `Get/Set-Content` corruption class); patterns
  are ASCII-escaped so the gate can never flag itself.
- **Doctor config path-rot probe** — `ledger.registration`, `l5.highRiskPaths`
  and `qa.criticalPaths` entries that no longer exist on disk are flagged
  (registration rot is CRITICAL — the drift nudge goes blind; gate/QA ghosts are
  advisory).

## [2.1.0] - 2026-06-11

### Added — swarm coordinator contracts locked (ADR-0051, Proposed)
- **ADR-0051** hardens the swarm feasibility study into contracts: `/swarm`
  skill + pure `swarm-plan.mjs` planner + `swarm-state.mjs` manifest,
  `swarm-dispatch` consent area (`['manual','manual','suggest','auto']`),
  optional `by: {runId, workstream, agent}` on state.json events,
  worktree-per-workstream isolation with workstream seniority, and the
  defining safety property: **a swarm run finishes at `testing`, never `done`**
  — `/swarm review` batches the human approvals. v1 is grade-3; grade-4 needs
  the ADR-0045 bar **plus ≥3 clean grade-3 runs**. Implementation = task 123
  (P0 zero-code validation run first).

### Added — cost-tiered model routing, Phase 1 (ADR-0052)
- **Every kit agent now declares a `model:` cost tier** in its Claude frontmatter
  (`haiku|sonnet|opus|inherit` — aliases only, never versioned IDs): expensive
  models think (architect, security squad, code-reviewer, agent-architect on
  `opus`), cheap models execute (qa-unit, qa-integration, packager,
  context-keeper on `haiku`), dispatchers inherit the session model. Claude Code
  enforces it natively on every Task dispatch; cache-safe by construction (the
  main loop never switches models — only spawned subagents are tiered).
- **Dispatch-time tier classification** in `/ship`, `/advise`, `/debate` and
  `/scaffold-tests`: think vs execute rules, floors (security work never below
  `sonnet`), one-step QA-failure escalation, budget-exhausted de-escalation
  (ADR-0044 §3 semantics: downgrade, never block).
- **Selfcheck guard**: every agent template must carry a valid model alias —
  a missing line or a versioned ID fails the build (rule 3).
- **Feasibility studies**: `docs/explanation/model-tier-routing-study.md`
  (3-layer architecture, savings arithmetic, host-gap statement, Phase 2/3
  deferrals) and `docs/explanation/swarm-feasibility-study.md` (swarm
  coordinator on the completed autonomy substrate, ADR-0051 reserved).

### Changed
- **Per-task `state.json` moved under `pipeline/state/` (ADR-0053).** The runtime
  substrate (ADR-0015 §C / ADR-0043) no longer scatters numbered dirs across the
  pipeline root beside the board stages — it lives in its own
  `contextkit/pipeline/state/<id>/state.json`, and the installer now **gitignores**
  `contextkit/pipeline/state/` (it is churning in-flight state, not the shared
  board). `listStates` reads only the substrate (skipping the stage dirs), fixing
  both the clutter and the commit/merge-conflict risk. Fully backward-compatible:
  `readState` falls back to the legacy flat path and `migrateStateLayout` (run on
  every `pipeline.mjs sync`) self-heals existing projects on the next command —
  idempotent, never clobbers. Covered by selfcheck + integration (start writes
  under `state/`; a legacy dir migrates on sync).
- **capability-matrix refreshed to 2026-06 reality (authorized by ADR-0052 per
  ADR-0012 §6):** `claude-opus-4-7` ($15/$75, stale) → `claude-opus-4-8`
  ($5/$25, 1M ctx); Haiku 4.5 corrected to $1/$5; Sonnet 4.6 context 1M;
  **Claude Fable 5 added** (premium, $10/$50, 1M ctx, thinking-always-on note);
  decision-rules + manifest seed follow the ID rename. Matrix v0.2.0,
  `updated: 2026-06-11`.
- **Antigravity parity doc** records the honest host gap: tier routing is Claude
  Code only — agy exposes no per-agent/per-dispatch model API; the kit refuses
  to fake a Gemini mapping it cannot enforce (rule 8).

## [2.0.0] - 2026-06-11

### Added — F4 grade-4 control plane (ADR-0045, task 116 — completes the autonomy package F0–F4)
- **Deterministic eligibility bar.** `/autonomy 4` now consults
  `autonomy-eligibility.mjs` and **refuses naming the failing criterion** unless
  ALL hold: ≥ 30 recorded transitions (genuine `from ≠ to` events) · ≥ 20 sessions ·
  rollback rate < 10% (`qa`/`evict` events) · zero wiring-drift incidents · a fresh
  self-coverage marker · attribution (D3) present. Unmeasurable ⇒ refuse, never pass
  (rule 8): no events ⇒ rollback rate 1.0, no marker ⇒ coverage/attribution fail.
- **Gated, session-default setter.** Grade 4 is `experimental`: with no flags it is
  **session-scoped** (auto-expiring), and persisting requires `--persist --confirm`
  after the consequence text is shown. No path persists grade 4 silently; the
  grade-change floor (always human) is untouched.
- **Self-coverage readiness harness.** New `autonomy-readiness.mjs` runs `npm test`
  under `NODE_V8_COVERAGE` (every `runtime/hooks/**` + `runtime/config/**` module must
  be exercised) and `token-report` for attribution, stamping the marker the bar reads.
  It never flips a criterion true on its own failure.
- **Hardened quorum + kill-switch (`/ship`).** At grade 4 a ◆ checkpoint cleared by
  `/debate` requires: blind voices · **≥ 1 deterministic voice = the exit codes of
  `npm test` + selfcheck + `/deps-audit`** (not an LLM summary) · a security **Critical
  is a veto, not a vote** · `unresolved` → human · the deliberation id stamped into the
  `state.json` event. The resolver is re-consulted at the **start of every step** so any
  user message or `/autonomy 1` yields/cancels at the next boundary; push stays
  branch-only (merge to default is always human).
- **Security-review hardenings (pre-merge).** A `security` pass flagged the bar's
  evidence as agent-writable; fixed: `memory/autonomy/**` is now a **floored path**
  (editing the eligibility evidence is gate-self-edit class, so an agent cannot forge
  its own bar), the readiness marker must be **fresh (≤ 14 days)** to count, the
  resolver's grade-4 contradiction guard **fails closed** (`deliberations.active !==
  true` ⇒ throw, absent is not assumed-on), and only genuine stage transitions count.
- Covered by selfcheck (eligibility thresholds, refuse-by-default, the floored
  evidence cell, fail-closed, freshness) + integration (`autonomy 4` refuses on an
  unmet bar, passes session-scoped when seeded, `--persist` needs `--confirm`).

### Added — deferred-items consolidation, bucket A (ADR-0047, tasks 128–132)
- **PR line in `/git status`** (task 128). `git.mjs` surfaces the branch's open
  PR in one line, reusing `sync-check.mjs`'s PR facts (now exported behind an
  entrypoint guard — importing is side-effect-free). An unusable `gh` or a
  non-GitHub provider reports **skipped, never a false "none"** (rule 8).
- **`/advise --after --since <ref>`** (task 129). Pins the changed-surface scan
  to `git diff --name-only <ref>...HEAD` so long-lived branches stop
  over-reading; an unknown ref is a hard stop, never a silent full-branch
  fallback.
- **`pipeline.mjs board --digest`** (task 130). Token-light lane summary
  (active lanes in full, backlog capped at 8, titles clipped) on ADR-0027's
  deterministic-extraction posture; `/pipeline show` and `/plan-week` now
  reason from the digest instead of reading N task files.
- **Opt-in scheduled alert-sync** (task 131). The scaffolded `security.yml`
  ships a commented `schedule:` cron trigger + an `alert-sync` job (gated on
  `event_name == 'schedule'`, advisory) running the existing `gh-alerts.mjs` —
  inert until the project opts in; runs in the project's CI, never the kit hot
  path (rule 1).
- **Registry-backed staleness in `/deps-audit`** (task 132). `--registry` (the
  audit's only network call, opt-in by flag) flags a deprecated `latest` and
  packages with 2+ years without a publish via abbreviated npm-registry
  metadata; an unreachable registry is a `registry-skipped` finding — a skip,
  never a pass (rule 8). Env-overridable URL keeps the test suite offline.

### Fixed — pre-release audit, low-severity sweep (tasks 133–138, zeroed before the 2.0)
- **`matchSecret` widened to common credentials (133).** SSH private keys
  (`id_rsa`/`id_ed25519`/`id_dsa`/`id_ecdsa`), `.git-credentials`, `.dockercfg`, and
  cert/PGP extensions (`.crt/.cer/.cert/.der/.asc/.gpg`) now hit the secrets floor —
  so no consent grade auto-touches them. (`id_rsa.pub` stays a non-hit.)
- **Grade-blind selfcheck now catches resolver-mediated reads (134).** The invariant
  check flagged only the raw `config.autonomy` key; it now also flags a hook that
  branches on `resolveAutonomy(...).grade` / `readAutonomyOverride`, with the
  display-only `autonomy-signals.mjs` as an explicit allowlist (the audited surface,
  not a regex blind spot).
- **`[Unreleased]` boot digest miscounted nested sub-bullets (135).** The tally now
  anchors to column 0, so an indented sub-bullet is detail of its entry, not a new one.
- **`pipeline-board` digest crashed on a titleless card (136).** It now coerces a
  missing title to `(untitled)` — the digest is a never-crash summary (ADR-0027).
- **LP lawyer disclaimer is now non-removable by ENFORCEMENT (137).** `lp-build
  --check` refuses a `dist/` whose legal pages dropped the disclaimer (was convention
  only). [ADR-0050]
- **Readiness-marker threat model documented (138).** `autonomy-eligibility.mjs` now
  records that the marker is trust-on-write and why that's acceptable (grade-change is
  human-floored, `memory/autonomy/**` is a floored path, 14-day freshness, `--confirm`)
  and why an HMAC was considered and deferred. [ADR-0045]

### Fixed — pre-release audit of the ADR-0041…0050 package (4-way deep analysis + security review)
- **`auto-transition` could bypass the `qa-reject` monopoly (ADR-0043 §3).**
  `autoTransition` only fenced `conclusion`; it now refuses any move that isn't a
  legal forward step (`backlog→working→testing`). A `testing→working` bounce — which
  must carry feedback — is once again `qa-reject`-only, and backward/skip jumps are
  refused (use the human `move`). [HIGH]
- **Stale eviction left no event — the `evict` actor was dead (ADR-0043 §5).**
  `workspace-sync` moved a stale task `working→backlog` via `writeState` but never
  `appendEvent`, so the transition was invisible to the log and the grade-4 rollback
  metric (ADR-0045) under-counted abandonment. Eviction now appends an
  `actor:'evict'` event. [HIGH]
- **`/project-map` manifest churned on every commit (ADR-0046 §1 / ADR-0039).** The
  manifest carried a wall-clock `generatedAt`, so the pre-commit auto-refresh
  re-staged it on every source commit (git noise + merge-conflict surface). Dropped
  the field — the deterministic `signature` is the map's identity; the manifest is
  now byte-stable on a no-op regenerate.
- **`deps-audit` npm-v6 advisory path was dead** — a `data` → `parsed`
  ReferenceError inside `parseNpmAudit` was silently swallowed by the caller
  and downgraded real CVE output to `audit-skipped` on npm v6. (Found while
  implementing task 132.)

### Added — ADR-0044 D3 budget gate, now actually wired
- **Grade-4 budget downgrade (ADR-0044 D3).** The decision was documented but
  absent — the resolver never consulted the token budget despite the grade-4
  consequence text claiming "budget-gated." `resolveAutonomy` now honours
  `context.budgetExhausted`: at grade 4 an exhausted `tokens.budgetPerSession`
  returns grade-2 behaviour (`suggest`, `reason: 'budget-exhausted'`) — it
  **downgrades to consent, never blocks an edit** (rule 2); the floor still wins,
  and lower grades stay budget-warn-only. `/ship` passes the budget state when it
  re-consults the resolver per step. Per-command attribution's doc was also
  calibrated: `attributionSkill` is host-populated and legitimately sparse, so the
  "Top commands" lens is best-effort (the per-agent fan-out split is the guaranteed,
  budget-gate input).

### Added
- **`/project-map` becomes an active architectural-fitness substrate (ADR-0046).**
  The structural map stops being a passive doc: (1) **self-refreshing** — the
  pre-commit hook regenerates + `git add`s the map when source is staged (grade-blind
  derived doc, never blocks); (2) **architectural fitness functions** — an opt-in
  `memory/project-map/rules.json` declares path-prefix layering rules
  (`forbidden: from→to`) and sensitive-import rules; `project-map --check --strict`
  exits 1 on a violation (a new `project-map` job in `quality.yml` is the gate). The
  sensitive set is **augmented from the ADR-0041 secrets path-class** (`matchSecret`,
  reused not reinvented) — the floor gates *editing* a secret, this adds the *edge*
  view (who now imports it); (3) **structural insights** — dependency cycles, orphan
  and oversized modules, computed at generate-time into `manifest.json`, surfaced at
  boot and in an "Architecture health" section of `00-index.md`; (4) `--check` prints
  a token-cheap **delta** (+/− modules/edges); (5) `--for <path>` returns a focused
  **subgraph** so the ADR-0044 memory retriever can query the map. New
  `project-map-insights.mjs` + `project-map-rules.mjs` (pure siblings); `projectMap:
  { autoRefresh, enforce }` config block. Covered by selfcheck + integration
  (cycle, violation→exit-1, opt-in-off, `--for`).

### Added — F3 fan-out economy (ADR-0044, tasks 113–115)
- **D3 · per-agent / per-command token attribution.** `/token-report` now splits
  spend by **agent** (main loop vs subagent **fan-out**, from the transcript's
  `isSidechain`) and by **command** (from `attributionSkill`), in the human view and
  under `--json` — the honest input the grade-4 budget gate (ADR-0045) consumes and
  the proof-of-savings instrument. New pure `token-attribution.mjs`. **Deviation
  noted:** the ADR sketched a per-run ledger line written by `/debate`/`/ship`; the
  transcript already carries `attributionSkill` + `isSidechain`, so attribution is
  derived from records already parsed — strictly more accurate (a command cannot see
  its own final token count mid-run) and with **no new persisted artifact**, which
  structurally forecloses the ADR's named "memory-inflation" failure mode.
- **D1 · bounded subagent context pack.** `context-pack.mjs --for-subagent
  --objective "…"` emits a ≤~120-line pack (immutable-rules digest · last-session
  line · `[Unreleased]` digest · open claims · objective-targeted memory) carrying
  the standing rule *"do not re-read boot context; read at most 1 file to verify a
  claim."* `/debate`, `/advise` and `/ship` (and the antigravity mirrors) now embed
  it in every fan-out Task prompt — the pattern the 06 master round validated.
- **D5 · deterministic memory retriever.** New `memory-retrieve.mjs` selects the
  memory **already extracted** by the digest layer (glossary rows · ADR catalog
  lines scored by title overlap · the latest-session one-liner · the project-map
  `--for` subgraph) for an objective — no generation, no placeholders, hard-capped
  at 40 lines, idempotent (same objective + repo state ⇒ byte-identical).
- **D2 · compact `[Unreleased]` boot digest.** The SessionStart banner replaces the
  raw section with a count-by-type tally (`Added 2 · Fixed 1 …`) + the most recent
  entries via the `md-extract` seam (`digestUnreleased`), falling back to the raw
  truncated section on any parse miss (same contract as the ADR-0027 boot digest).
- Covered by selfcheck source-cases + a dedicated `integration-test-token-economy.mjs`
  suite (attribution split, retriever cap/idempotency/placeholder-guard, bounded
  subagent pack, the `[Unreleased]` digest + its raw fallback).

### Changed — Antigravity host goes native (ADR-0048 + ADR-0049)
- **Host assets moved `.antigravity/` → `.agents/` (ADR-0048).** The agy binary
  resolves workspace skills strictly from `.agents/`, so the kit-invented
  `.antigravity/` was never read — typing `/` in the agy TUI showed *"No
  matching results"*. The installer now targets `.agents/` (single-sourced as
  `ANTIGRAVITY_DIR` in `paths.mjs`, rule 4), auto-removes the kit-owned legacy
  tree on update, purges both on `--uninstall --purge`, and ships a
  host-coexistence README (`.claude/` = Claude Code, `.agents/` = agy; neither
  reads the other). `/context-doctor` flags a leftover legacy tree as
  migratable. Slash commands now autocomplete natively in the agy TUI.

### Added — native agy lifecycle hooks (ADR-0049)
- **`.agents/hooks.json` composer.** New
  `runtime/config/agent-hooks-compose.mjs` (`composeAgentHooks` /
  `stripAgentHooks`) — the agy twin of `settings-compose.mjs`, owning a single
  `contextdevkit` group and preserving user groups. Level rules mirror the
  Claude wiring 1:1 (L1 SessionStart · L2 +PostToolUse +Stop · L3
  +concurrency-guard · L5 +simulate-gate +deliberation-nudge); wired by the
  installer, re-wired by `/context-level`, stripped by `--uninstall`.
- **Host adapter — one seam, no forked hooks.** New
  `runtime/hooks/host-adapter.mjs` normalizes both wire formats (Claude
  `tool_input.file_path` ⇄ agy `toolCall.args.TargetFile`), emits the
  host-correct blocking key (`block` ⇄ `deny`), rides advisories on an explicit
  `decision: allow` under agy, and resolves the agy session id from the
  `.agy-active.json` marker `session-manager start` now mints (one ledger per
  agy session instead of one per hook event). `track-edits`,
  `concurrency-guard`, `simulate-gate` and `deliberation-nudge` swapped their
  private extractors for the adapter — the L5 gate, edit ledger, cross-claim
  warnings and the deliberation nudge now fire automatically in agy.
- **Tests.** Selfcheck: composer level table, per-tool matchers, idempotence +
  user-group preservation, payload-normalization table, ADR-0048/0049 source
  cases (check floor 660 → 711+ executed). Integration: `.agents/` install +
  no-legacy-tree + coexistence README cells (tooling suite); hooks.json wiring,
  agy session minting, `track-edits --host agy` ledgering and the
  `simulate-gate --host agy` deny verdict (antigravity suite).

### Added — conversion squad + deterministic LP scaffold (ADR-0050)
- **`lp-scaffold.mjs` + `lp-build.mjs` + `starters/landing/`.** The landing
  page stops being AI-hand-written (~30–60K tokens) and becomes deterministic:
  componentized source (one fold per file, `content/copy.json` as the AI's
  only editing surface) assembled into one atomic indexable `dist/` —
  `--check` refuses leftover `{{tokens}}`/`[PREENCHA]` sentinels and runs
  `seo-audit` + `aiso-audit` against the output (born green, asserted in CI).
  Resolves ADR-0023's deferred starter without inventing domain content
  (structure + placeholders only, rule 9).
- **LGPD by default.** Cookie-consent component ships ON (Consent Mode
  default-denied, < 2 KB, accessible); GTM included directly but **ID-less**
  (inert until configured, loaded only after consent); Meta/TikTok/LinkedIn
  pixels ship as commented, consent-wrapped **models** (`tracking-models.js`,
  never in dist); privacy policy + terms of use generated as drafts from
  `content/legal.json` with a non-removable lawyer-review disclaimer; lead
  forms decoupled via webhook (n8n/Make) with loading/success/error states.
- **Two design-team agents.** `conversion-strategist` (interview-first
  strategy — niche/pain/single-CTA/sophistication — neurodesign techniques
  with verification steps, benefit copy; refuses invented social proof) and
  `tracking-integrator` (GTM/pixels/webhooks, consent-first by contract,
  pairs with `privacy-lgpd`). Lean agents + tier-2 briefings under
  `squads/design-team/`.
- **Playbook + skill v2.** `landing-page.md` gains the fold-anatomy menu
  (persuasive function per fold), the neurodesign verify-don't-vibe table,
  the legal & consent defaults and the deterministic path; `/landing-page`
  now runs interview → indexability → scaffold → fill → `--check` gates.
  Refused, on record: fixed Next/React stack mandate, a parallel 150-line
  cap, 7-fold minimum, example social proof, auto-wired pixels.
- **Tests.** New sibling suite `tools/integration-test-lp.mjs` (25 checks:
  write-if-missing, refuse-on-placeholder, consent/GTM/pixel contract,
  disclaimer presence, copy round-trip, fold selection) + selfcheck inventory
  for both scripts, both agents, briefings and the starter tree.

## [1.17.0] - 2026-06-10

### Added — backlog-zero batch (tickets 084–096)
- **`agy guard <path>` — explicit L5 pre-edit checkpoint (095).** Governance
  parity for the hook-less Antigravity host: exit 0 = allowed, exit 1 = high-risk
  path with no covering `/simulate-impact` record (refuse-by-default, including
  on errors). Shares `matchHighRisk` with the PreToolUse hook via
  `path-classification.mjs`; documented in `INSTRUCTIONS.md.tpl` and the
  session-start rules.
- **`help <command>` + did-you-mean in `ctx.mjs` (096).** Unknown commands print
  the closest 3 matches instead of dumping the six-category menu; `help <cmd>`
  prints a single-command card. The categorised registry moved to
  `runtime/antigravity/ctx-menu.mjs` (graceful fallback when the engine is absent).
- **Antigravity-aware `/context-doctor` (086).** Verifies `ctx.mjs`, the
  `ctx`/`agy` package.json shortcuts, the four `.antigravity` asset trees,
  `INSTRUCTIONS.md`, and leftover `{{TOKEN}}` placeholders — advisory-only, a
  Claude-only project never fails doctor over the optional host.
- **Antigravity parity drift-guard in selfcheck (084).** `templates/antigravity`
  must track `templates/claude` 1:1 (both directions, by relative path) or
  selfcheck fails pointing at `npm run build:antigravity`.
- **New integration suite `tools/integration-test-antigravity.mjs`** covering the
  `ctx.mjs` dispatch contract, the guard checkpoint, the shared drift predicate
  and the doctor checks; joined the `npm test` chain.

### Fixed
- **`ctx.mjs` silent prefix dispatch (089).** `agy tech` no longer guesses
  `tech-debt-scan.mjs` via `startsWith` — exact names and declared aliases only;
  a near-miss fails loudly with suggestions.
- **`convert-all.mjs` generated the Antigravity host from the wrong source (085).**
  It read the CURRENT project's `.claude/` (the kit's dogfood install), shipping a
  kit-local agent, missing newer commands (`debate`, `plan-week`, `project-map`)
  and keeping 33 stale flat duplicates after the taxonomy reorg. New `--templates`
  mode reads `templates/claude` + `templates/contextkit/workflows` with a
  clean-first build (top-level README.md preserved), wired as
  `npm run build:antigravity` — a kit build step, never the user `--update` path.
  Tree regenerated: 73 skills / 33 agents / 7 playbooks / 6 workflows, 1:1.
- **Antigravity drift detection disagreed with the Stop hook (092).**
  `session-manager` carried its own inline "important file" filter (it wrongly
  ignored `.claude/` edits, under-reporting drift); it now consumes the canonical
  config-driven predicate (`pendingImportantPaths`) from `hooks/ledger.mjs`.
- **Dispatch confinement + trust model (090).** Resolved scripts must stay under
  `contextkit/tools/scripts`; the project-local trust assumption both runners
  share with npm scripts / git hooks is documented in their headers.

### Changed
- **Installer io convention unified (091).** The `engine`/`claude`/`antigravity`
  installers import `fs.mjs` directly; the pass-through `io` object and parameter
  are gone (half the modules already imported directly — one convention now).

### Added
- **`/project-map` module dependency graph — blast-radius edges (ADR-0040).**
  The map gains a **"Module dependencies (who imports whom)"** section in
  `00-index.md` — deterministic edges between mapped modules, resolved from import
  statements (zero AI tokens). New `project-map-deps.mjs` extracts JS/TS-family
  imports (`import … from`, `require()`, dynamic `import()`) and resolves each to a
  target module by **relative path** or **workspace package name** (from each
  module's `package.json`); externals (node_modules) are ignored. Edges are sorted
  → the committed docs stay churn-free (ADR-0039), and deps are deliberately kept
  OUT of the structural signature. Symbol extraction moved to a sibling
  `project-map-symbols.mjs` (cohesion — keeps `project-map-core.mjs` under budget).
  v1 covers the JS/TS family; other languages' edges are deferred (documented, not
  silent). Pairs with `/simulate-impact`. Covered by selfcheck + a cross-module
  edge round-trip in the tooling integration test.

### Changed
- **`/project-map` staleness via a deterministic structural fingerprint (ADR-0039).**
  The map signature was `modules:files:mtime` — printed in every doc header — so
  regenerating an unchanged project **churned** the committed docs, and the boot
  nudge (which compared `generatedAt` to the newest mtime) **false-fired after
  every clone** (clone resets mtimes). The signature is now a `sha256` over each
  module's `path:files:bytes` (no mtime, no clock): an unchanged tree renders
  **byte-identical** docs (zero churn) and `--check` is exact. The date is dropped
  from the doc bodies (kept in `manifest.json` + console). `projectMapStale` now
  compares each module's saved `{files, bytes}` against a bounded (≤400-stat)
  recompute — structural, clone-safe, and it **skips** a cap-truncated module
  rather than false-flag it (rule 8). Self-contained (no `git`, no `tools/` import).
  Covered by selfcheck + churn-free + stale-on-edit integration asserts.


### Added
- **`/project-map` — deterministic, stack-agnostic structural map (durable memory).**
  A new zero-AI-token mapper (`contextkit/tools/scripts/project-map{,-core,-render}.mjs`)
  scans the project and writes a committed map under `contextkit/memory/project-map/`:
  `00-index.md` (one-screen overview — stack + modules classified 🎨 frontend /
  ⚙️ backend / 🔗 shared / 🛠️ config), `01-modules.md`, `02-inventory.md` (sampled
  exported symbols), and a `manifest.json` signature. The agent reads the index
  INSTEAD of re-greping the tree each session. `--check` diffs the saved signature
  (`--strict` exits 1 for CI), and the SessionStart boot context nudges 🗺️ when the
  map is older than the newest source edit (bounded mtime walk, ≤400 stats — rule 2).
  Output path single-sourced via `pathsFor().projectMap` (rule 4); the installer
  seeds `memory/project-map/`. Claude host this release; the Antigravity mirror
  follows with the host-modular pass. Covered by selfcheck + a frontend/backend
  classification round-trip in the tooling integration test.
- **Legacy-install migration (rename follow-through).** `install.mjs` now carries
  an old `vibekit/` install forward to `contextkit/` automatically on `npx
  contextdevkit --update` (and via an explicit `node install.mjs --migrate
  [--dry-run]`). New `tools/install/migrate.mjs`: atomically MOVES the folder
  (preserving memory/ADRs, config + level, pipeline tasks, `.env`), rewrites the
  rename tokens in `settings.json` (killing the duplicate-hook trap),
  `.gitignore`, `.gitattributes`, git-hook wrappers, `contextkit/.env`, and
  `CLAUDE.md` (the last two backed up to `*.bak`), and deletes the stale
  `/vibe-*` + `setupvibedevkit` command files. Refuses (no-op + warning) when
  BOTH folders exist; idempotent; never throws into the installer (rule 2). New
  `tools/integration-test-migrate.mjs` (25 asserts) wired into `test` +
  `prepublishOnly`.
- **agent-forge squad — Fase 6: declarative pipeline DSL + dry-run engine
  (ADR-0015 Part A).** The forge's orchestration is now a diffable, simulate-
  impact-mappable plan. New `templates/contextkit/squads/agent-forge/pipeline.yaml`
  declares the 9 build steps (validate-blueprint → route →
  checkpoint-shortlist → generate-prompt → generate-tools? → generate-rag? →
  governance → eval-gate (on_reject → generate-prompt, max_cycles: 3) →
  package). New `templates/contextkit/tools/scripts/squad-pipeline.mjs` engine
  parses via `lib/yaml.mjs` (ADR-0013 optional dynamic import) and refuses on
  missing `yaml` with **exit 0 + informative** message — pipelines are opt-in,
  not hot-path. New `squad-pipeline-condition.mjs` is the whitelisted
  condition parser: only `<id>(.<id>)* <op> <literal>` and `…length <op>
  <int>` (no function calls, no boolean chaining, no arithmetic). `--dry-run`
  walks the graph against an empty context and prints the would-be execution
  order with markers `✓` runs · `⊘` skipped by condition · `↺` has retry
  loop. `max_review_cycles` is a hard cap (engine exits "manual escalation
  required" rather than looping past it); vendor model names are refused
  (only `model_tier: fast|powerful|reasoning` — the router stays the single
  resolver). 2 new selfchecks in `selfcheck-agent-forge.mjs`
  (`checkConditionParser` + `checkSquadPipeline`, 8 assertions). 4 new
  integration asserts (pipeline ships, validates, yaml-absent informative
  path). Spec: `docs/SQUAD-PIPELINE-FORMAT.md` (258 lines). `state.json` per
  run is deferred to task 040 (ADR-0015 Part C). The agent-forge ROADMAP
  Fase 6 row flips to ✅; opensquad-inspired but reshaped — full expression
  eval, vendor names in YAML, and auto-state are deliberately rejected.
- **agent-forge squad — Fase 5: RAG designer + Go runtime + L5 gate + /fleet
  Forge Stats.** Closes the original blueprint. New `lib/rag-designer.mjs`
  generates the `rag/` bundle from the blueprint when `capabilities.rag` is
  true — multilingual-vs-english embedding from `intent.domain`, pgvector vs
  qdrant from residency, recursive chunk sizing tightened for extraction,
  `top_k` scaled by complexity, hybrid search + reranker on by default. The
  packager now also stamps `{{AGENT_NAME}}` / `{{MODULE_PATH}}` into the Go
  runtime adapter (`go.mod` + README). `defaults.l5.highRiskPaths` ships with
  `agent-packages/**` so any forged-agent edit triggers the simulate-impact
  gate. `fleet.mjs cmdStats` aggregates per-repo Forge Stats and surfaces a
  fleet-total `🔥 Forge fleet: N packages across M repos…` line. Selfcheck
  split: build-pipeline checks stay in `selfcheck-agent-forge.mjs` (225
  lines), Fase 4+5 ops checks moved to the new `selfcheck-agent-forge-ops.mjs`
  (real responsibility seam). New `rag-designer.md` briefing — refuses
  pinecone under no-cloud, refuses `top_k < 4`. (035)
- **agent-forge squad — Fase 4: production maintenance + Forge Stats + reference
  docs.** Operating a fleet of forged agents in production now has tools.
  `lib/package-ops.mjs` discovers `<name>@<semver>/` dirs without needing the
  yaml dep, loads manifests + provenance via the optional path, diagnoses
  structural problems (missing files OR `{{TOKEN}}` placeholders in
  governance YAMLs), and aggregates monthly budgets. Three CLI modules wire
  **13 new `/forge-*` slash commands**: `cli/forge-ops.mjs`
  (list/show/doctor/policy/budget/audit — read-only),
  `cli/forge-eval-cli.mjs` (eval/redteam/route/fallback-test with `--provider
  mock|chaos` for CI), `cli/forge-admin.mjs` (refresh-matrix/killswitch/
  deprecate — dry-run by default, atomic tmp+rename writes on `--write`).
  Each command has a thin briefing under `templates/claude/commands/forge-*.md`
  carrying its refusal conditions. The Node runtime adapter ships a
  `createShadowEval` scaffold (sample rate from
  `quality.policy.yaml.eval_gates.drift_monitoring.sample_pct`; real scoring
  delegated to the package's `evals/`). `/context-stats` gains a **Forge Stats**
  section (package count, eval-stamp ratio, aggregate target + hard cap,
  distribution by primary provider). New reference docs:
  [`docs/SQUADS/agent-forge.md`](docs/SQUADS/agent-forge.md) +
  [`docs/AGENT-PACKAGE-FORMAT.md`](docs/AGENT-PACKAGE-FORMAT.md). Selfcheck
  gains `checkPackageOps` + 19 inventory entries (13 commands + 6 files).
  ROADMAP §8 / §9 / §10 (Forge Stats) all ✅; Fase 4 ✅. (034)
- **agent-forge squad — Fase 3: governance + eval gate (the refuse-to-ship layer).**
  Principle 5 ("Eval before embarkation") is now enforced in code. Three pure
  zero-dep modules carry the gate: `lib/eval-designer.mjs` (`designEvalSet` seeds
  golden by `intent.category` + the universal red-team baseline of
  prompt-injection / jailbreak / PII-leak + a rubric + thresholds derived from
  blueprint privacy/sla/cost — PII-leak block rate forced to 1.0 when
  `pii_present`); `lib/eval-runner.mjs` (`runEvalSuite`, provider-agnostic — mock
  for CI, real adapter for production — supports `exact` / `exact_set` /
  `numeric_tolerance:N` / `semantic_similarity:>=N`; aggregates p95 latency + cost
  and refuses pass when any threshold breaches); `lib/governance-officer.mjs`
  (`attachGovernance` builds the three pillars populated from the blueprint
  plus the fallback chain from the router decision; `validateGovernance` refuses
  on missing sections OR unresolved `{{TOKEN}}` placeholders). `packageAgent`
  now calls `attachGovernance` first (throws early), writes 4 populated
  governance YAMLs + 4 populated eval files (overwriting templates), and stamps
  `provenance.eval_passed_at` ONLY when `opts.evalResult.verdict === 'pass'`.
  `forgeNew` gains an opt-in `runEval = { provider, semantic }` that runs the
  gate before packaging. Two new agent briefings ship: `eval-designer.md` (drives
  the 10–50 golden expansion + domain red-team) and `governance-officer.md`
  (three pillars equal-weight, refuse-over-rubber-stamp). 11 new behavioural
  selfchecks + 6 new integration asserts. (033)
- **agent-forge squad — Fase 2: multi-provider + Python runtime adapter.** All five
  providers now flow end-to-end through the pipeline. `prompt-gen.mjs` gains
  `renderGoogle` (Markdown body for `systemInstruction` + safetySettings note),
  `renderDeepSeek` (OpenAI-compat with an explicit CoT cue prepended to Rules),
  `renderOllama` (Markdown body; the per-model `chat_template` is applied by the
  runtime, not embedded). `tool-gen.mjs` gains `renderGoogle` with
  `downConvertForGemini` that recursively strips JSON-Schema fields Gemini's
  `functionDeclarations` parser rejects (`additionalProperties`, `$schema`, `$id`,
  `$ref`), plus `renderDeepSeek` + `renderOllama` mirroring OpenAI's `type:function`
  shape. `packager.mjs` writes the full 5 prompt files + 5 tool adapter files on
  every package, and a new `stampRuntimeAdapters` replaces `{{AGENT_NAME}}` /
  `{{SEE_LICENSE}}` in Node `package.json` + Python `pyproject.toml` (+ their
  READMEs) when those runtimes are requested. `architect.mjs` promotes
  `runtime_adapters` to a first-class blueprint field (`enum-multi` over
  `[node, python, go]`, default `[node]`) — `validateBlueprint` rejects unknown
  entries, `fillDefaults` defaults it, `assembleManifest` stamps
  `spec.runtime_adapters` straight from the blueprint. Integration test gains 7
  new asserts across both branches (yaml-available + no-yaml CI default) covering
  every new provider + the Python adapter token stamping. (032)
- **agent-forge squad — Fase 1 MVP: end-to-end forge pipeline.** The squad now
  produces a real Agent Package. Six pure, zero-dep `lib/*.mjs` modules carry the
  pipeline: `architect.mjs` (canonical `INTERVIEW_QUESTIONS` + `validateBlueprint` +
  `fillDefaults` + canonicalized SHA-256 `blueprintHash` for provenance);
  `router.mjs` + `router/decision-rules.json` (13 rules under the 15-cap, structural
  shortlists only — quality verdicts deferred to the eval harness per ADR-0012 §5);
  `prompt-gen.mjs` (canonical Markdown → Anthropic XML with `cache=ephemeral` +
  OpenAI Markdown sections); `tool-gen.mjs` (canonical JSON schemas → Anthropic
  `{name,description,input_schema}` array + OpenAI `type:function` wrapper);
  `packager.mjs` (split into pure `assembleManifest` + I/O `packageAgent` —
  stamps provenance, replaces the README rationale slot, writes provider files).
  The optional `yaml` dep (ADR-0013) is touched only at write time via `lib/yaml.mjs`.
  Six lean `.claude/agents/forge-*.md` briefings (orchestrator / architect /
  router / prompt-engineer / tool-designer / packager) plus the `/forge-new` slash
  command and the executable `cli/forge-new.mjs` (exports `forgeNew()` for the
  integration test). Selfcheck gains `checkRouterEngine` — a behavioural guard
  that exercises a typical extraction blueprint AND the no-cloud constraint,
  asserting the rationale carries the eval-as-authority disclaimer. (031)
- **Installer copies the agent-forge squad at L>=4.** Fase-0 leftover fixed —
  without this, the squad existed only in the source tree and installed projects
  could not run `/forge-new`. Guarded by a `checkSourceInvariants` regex so a
  silent regression is impossible.
- **Integration round-trip for `/forge-new`.** New block in
  `integration-test-tooling.mjs`: when the optional `yaml` dep is installed,
  drives `forgeNew` to write a complete APF into a temp `agent-packages/...@0.1.0/`
  and asserts 11 expected files + stamped blueprint hash + routed primary
  provider + Anthropic XML prompt + OpenAI function-typed tools + Node adapter.
  When `yaml` is absent (default CI), exercises the pure half of the pipeline
  (validate → route → `assembleManifest` → generators) with the same invariants
  in memory — CI proves correctness end-to-end either way.
- **agent-forge squad — foundations (Fase 0).** New *factory* squad that forges
  portable, multi-provider Agent Packages for projects outside the kit. Scaffolded
  `templates/contextkit/squads/agent-forge/` with its README (mandate, roster, boundary)
  and `best-practices.md` (the bar every forged agent clears — five principles, the
  default catalogue, provider notes, three-pillar governance, eval lifecycle).
  Seeded `router/capability-matrix.json` (5 providers, 11 models, dated + ADR-gated)
  with a selfcheck guard that parses it and rejects malformed / duplicate / disallowed
  model ids. Materialized the full APF v1 template tree (`templates/agent-package/`,
  45 files): manifest, canonical + per-provider prompts, canonical tool schema +
  per-provider tool adapters, the eval set (golden / red-team / rubric / thresholds /
  run-eval), three governance policies + fallback-chain + audit schema, RAG config,
  and Node / Python / Go runtime-adapter stubs. Selfcheck inventory guards the docs +
  representative APF files. Approved by ADR-0012; remaining phases on the DevPipeline
  (031–035). (030)

## [1.4.2] - 2026-05-25

### Changed
- **CI actions bumped to Node 24 majors** (re-pinned by SHA): `actions/checkout`
  v4→v6, `actions/setup-node` v4→v6, `actions/dependency-review-action` v4→v5 —
  across `release.yml`, `ci.yml` and the scaffolded `quality.yml`/`security.yml`
  templates. Clears GitHub's Node 20 runtime-deprecation warning (forced Node 24
  on 2026-06-02). CodeQL stays on v3 (no Node 24 major yet). Still SHA-pinned.

## [1.4.1] - 2026-05-25

DevPipeline backlog cleared (all 25 open tasks) — bug fixes, supply-chain &
test hardening, and single-source refactors. No public API removed.

### Fixed
- **Network git calls now time out** (`git.mjs`, `pre-push.mjs`) — an unreachable
  remote could hang `/git status` and any push. Bounded via `CONTEXT_GIT_TIMEOUT_MS`. (007)
- **Boot banner**: `[Unreleased]` clipped past 60 lines now shows a `(truncated)`
  marker (009); `extractLatestSession` breaks a session-number tie by the later date (010).
- **`applyPreset`** no longer crashes on a partial/custom preset missing `l5`/`qa`/`ledger`. (013)
- **Atomic writes** (tmp-file + rename) for the ledger, workspace, pipeline and claim
  writers — a concurrent reader can't see a half-written file; pipeline ids are now
  collision-safe (exclusive create). (011)
- **`SessionStart`** no longer deletes a live concurrent session's fresh ledger. (008)

### Security
- **`sanitizeSid`** applied at every workspace-path construction (claim/release/track-edits)
  — defense-in-depth against `../` traversal in a session id. (012)
- **GitHub Actions pinned to commit SHAs** across release/ci + the security/quality
  workflow templates; **`ci.yml` is least-privilege** (`contents: read`). (019, 020)
- **README "Security & trust"** section — npx/hook-install + tag-pinning + fleet/detector
  code-execution disclosure; installer **backs up an existing git hook** to `.bak`. (021, 022)

### Added
- **Guards test suite** (`integration-test-guards.mjs`): commit-msg, pre-push
  (block/warn/allow/bypass), config-loader fallbacks, uninstall/purge, concurrency-guard
  external-edit, gh-alerts mappers, malformed-settings recovery. (014–018)
- **Pluggable-detector seed** `contextkit/detectors/` (README + inert example), now installed. (026)

### Changed
- **Single-source level taxonomy** (`config/levels.mjs`) + **passthrough config schema**
  (no more `max(5)` cap; keeps every section). [ADR-0010] (024, 025)
- **Single-source platform paths** via `pathsFor(root)`; a selfcheck guard now fails on any
  hardcoded `contextkit/` path construction (rule 4). [ADR-0011] (023)
- **Shared zero-dep helpers**: `readJsonSafe`/`parseJsonSafe` + `squadOf`, killing duplicated
  BOM-parse / squad-detection code. (027, 028)
- Line-budget cohesion notes + constitution nits (dead imports, bare-var renames);
  `selfcheck.mjs` split to stay under the RED-zone gate. (005, 006, 029)

## [1.4.0] - 2026-05-25

### Changed
- **Recommended starting level by project type** (ADR-0009) — the installer now
  defaults to **L3** for a greenfield/empty folder and **L7** for a project that
  already has code (was: always recommend L2). `--level` still pins; a re-install
  preserves an existing project's level. Not intrusive — the L5 simulate-gate stays
  inert until `l5.highRiskPaths` is set. Docs retagged (`cli` labels, `LEVELS.md`
  with new L6/L7 sections, both `instrucoes.md`, README quickstart).

### Fixed
- **Level cap stuck at 6.** `install.mjs` silently downgraded `--level 7` to 2, and
  `doctor.mjs` flagged a valid L7 project as "config.level out of range". Both now
  accept **1–7**. Also corrected stale `1-5`/`1-6` range hints across `/context-level`,
  `/setupcontextdevkit`, `settings-compose`, and `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`.

## [1.3.0] - 2026-05-25

### Added
- **L7 "Ecosystem & Scale" — new capability tier.** The shipped Future-directions
  capabilities (fleet, agent-tuning, editor/CI, detectors/presets, token economy,
  playbooks, visual tests) are now a real activation level: **`/context-level 7`**.
  Wiring only — `getLevel` 1→7, level labels + `--level 1-7`, `defaults` docs; **no
  new hook** (same capability-tier pattern as L6). [→ ADR-0008]
- **Diverse & visual testing harness (MVP)** — `/visual-test` + `visual-test.mjs`
  **scaffold** a browser-driven visual layer (screenshot / visual-regression) for the
  detected stack: Playwright **JS** (`@playwright/test`) + **Python** (pytest-playwright);
  `status` detects an existing harness. Owned by `qa-e2e`; wired into `/scaffold-tests`,
  `/qa-signoff`, `/ship`. The runner is a project dependency — the kit scaffolds, never
  bundles/runs browsers (zero-dep hot path). Roadmap *Future directions* #6.
- **Fleet mode (MVP)** — `/fleet` + `fleet.mjs`: a control plane over many repos.
  Registry outside any repo (`~/.contextdevkit/fleet.json`, override `CONTEXT_FLEET_FILE`);
  `add`/`remove`/`list`, `stats` (aggregate each repo's `stats.mjs`), `audit`
  (aggregate `deep-analysis`), and `propagate <rule-file>` (report which repos'
  `CLAUDE.md` **lack** a rule — detect-only, no cross-repo edits). Zero-dep, defensive.
- **Outcome-driven agent tuning (MVP)** — `/tune-agents` + `agent-tuning.mjs`:
  aggregates per-agent signals (tier-2 briefing coverage + usage mentions across
  sessions) and **proposes** briefing refinements to `.agent-tuning-proposal.md`
  (gitignored); applies nothing, mirroring `/distill-sessions`. Promotes roadmap
  *Future directions* #2/#3 from candidate to MVP.
- **Playbook management** (roadmap #8) — `playbook.mjs` + **`/playbook`** turn
  `contextkit/workflows/playbooks/` into a managed layer: **list** the registry, **show**
  a procedure, and **run** one (records a tracked entry in
  `contextkit/memory/playbook-runs.md`, then prints the steps). `/ship` and the squads can
  `run` a playbook instead of restating it. Zero-dep; covered by selfcheck + integration
  tests.
- **Token economy & usage insight** (roadmap #7) — `token-report.mjs` + **`/token-report`**
  read Claude Code's local session transcripts and aggregate token usage per session and
  per ISO week (input/output/cache), with a configurable budget (`tokens.budgetPerSession`)
  that flags hot sessions. Read-only, local, zero-dep, aggregated counts only. New
  integration test covers aggregation.
- **Predictions-review cadence** (roadmap #002) — when `predictionsReview.active` (on by
  default), the SessionStart hook reminds you to run `/predictions-review` every N sessions,
  but **only** when unreviewed `/simulate-impact` predictions exist (silent otherwise).
  Mirrors security-mode. New integration test covers the trigger.
- **Editor/CI surfaces (MVP)** — a **status-line widget** (`statusline.mjs`, wired as
  `settings.statusLine` at L≥1, preserving a user's own) and a **quality CI workflow**
  (`.github/workflows/quality.yml`: `contract-scan --ci` + `tech-debt --ci`). Roadmap
  *Future directions* #4. (The Claude-driven PR-review bot is deferred — needs Claude in CI.)
- **Pluggable detectors & stack presets (MVP)** — `tech-debt-scan` loads drop-in
  detectors from `contextkit/detectors/*.mjs` (defensive dynamic import); `install.mjs
  --preset next|go|python` merges a stack preset (ledger / high-risk / QA paths) into
  config via `presets.mjs`. Roadmap *Future directions* #5.

### Changed
- **Contract drift detection deepened** (`contract-scan.mjs`) — the export extractor
  now also catches `export default`, namespace re-exports (`export * [as N] from`),
  `declare`/`abstract` declarations, generators, and type-only `export type { … }`
  (and fixes an inline-`{ type X }` mis-parse). Stays regex-based and **zero-dep** by
  design — AST would need a parser dependency (see *Honest gaps* / ADR-0003). New
  integration test covers it.
- **Optional AST contract drift** (`contract-scan.mjs`, roadmap #001) — when a parser is
  importable (`acorn`, or a module named by `CONTEXT_CONTRACT_PARSER`), extraction uses the
  AST for precision; otherwise the deepened regex (the zero-dep default) is used. The kit
  ships no parser, so the default is unchanged. Integration test covers the AST path via a
  fake parser. [→ ADR-0003]

## [1.2.0] - 2026-05-24

### Added
- **`code-security` agent (security-team sub-specialist)** — owns the code's external
  attack surface: third-party integration code (API clients/SDKs, webhooks &
  callbacks, (de)serialization of external responses), dependency provenance/SBOM,
  and SAST/CodeQL triage. Mirrors `infra-security`; cross-linked from `security`
  (AppSec lead) and `infra-security` so the lanes don't overlap.
- **GitHub-native security** — `templates/github/dependabot.yml` + an **advisory**
  `security.yml` workflow (dependency-review on PRs + the `/deps-audit` gate + CodeQL),
  installed write-if-missing; **`gh-alerts.mjs`** syncs Dependabot + code-scanning
  alerts into the DevPipeline backlog (via the `gh` CLI; degrades to exit 0 without
  `gh`/repo/network); new **`/security-setup`** command ties scaffolding + sync together.
- **`/predictions-review` — closes the predicted-vs-actual loop** (ancestor parity #1,
  second half). `predictions-review.mjs` fills each `/simulate-impact` prediction's
  *Actual* section from the session ledger (paths changed vs predicted, delta both
  ways); auto-run by `/log-session`. The v1.1.0 write-half was a stub; the review half
  is now implemented. Covered by selfcheck + integration tests.
- **`workflows/` guides + playbooks** — installed `contextkit/workflows/` with per-level
  workflow docs (L1–L5, plus an L6 capability-tier note) and four reusable playbooks
  (`tech-debt-sweep`, `simulate-impact`, `distillation-cycle`, `security-batch`),
  generalized and translated from the source platform. Seeded write-if-missing by the
  installer (`copyTreeIfMissing`); covered by selfcheck + integration tests. Completes
  the post-1.0 **ancestor parity** focus (piece #3 of 3).

### Changed
- **`/deps-audit` grown into a dependency policy** — adds **license allow/deny** (from
  installed package metadata), a CycloneDX **SBOM** (`--sbom` → `contextkit/memory/sbom.json`),
  and **lockfile-drift** detection, driven by a new `deps` config block (`defaults.mjs`
  + optional zod `schema.mjs`). Findings still flow into the DevPipeline backlog.
  Zero-dep and defensive (never throws).

### Docs
- **Roadmap:** added — and shipped — the **"supply-chain & code security"** section
  (deepen the security-team), plus a **status-key convention** (`⏳ in progress`
  alongside `✅`/`📋`/`🟡`/`➖`) in `docs/ROADMAP.md` and the installed-project template;
  trimmed the now-resolved entries from *Honest gaps*.
- **Roadmap:** added two *Future directions* initiatives — **token economy & usage
  insight** (per-session token reporting via `/token-report`, budgets, and cost-driven
  optimization, extending L6 Insight) and **playbook management** (a registry +
  `/playbook` to list/show/run/track reusable procedures), cross-linked to the existing
  `workflows/playbooks/` ancestor-parity foundation.

## [1.1.0] - 2026-05-24

### Added
- **Two-tier squad briefings** — `squad.mjs brief <agent>` scaffolds a rich briefing
  into `contextkit/squads/<squad>/<agent>.md` (squad auto-detected) behind the lean
  `.claude/agents/` agent; `squad.mjs list` shows briefing coverage. Wired into
  `/squad`. Ancestor parity #2.
- **`memory/predictions/`** — `/simulate-impact` (`mark-simulation.mjs`) now writes a
  prediction file per run (objective · covered paths · predicted-vs-actual stub),
  seeded on install. First step of the post-1.0 **ancestor parity** focus.

### Docs
- **Roadmap:** marked the 1.0 milestone **shipped** (per-item status + the extras
  delivered) and set **ancestor parity** as the post-1.0 focus.

## [1.0.0]

### Added
- **Security mode (active, not reactive)** — a SessionStart trigger reminds you to
  run `/deep-analysis` every `securityMode.everyNSessions` sessions (default 10),
  **on by default**; disable with `securityMode.active: false`. The manual
  `/deep-analysis` command stays available anytime.
- **`/deep-analysis` (global sweep)** — `deep-analysis.mjs` aggregates every
  deterministic scanner (tech-debt, deps, contract) into one report; the command
  adds judgment (security / architecture / bug pass), suggests ADRs, and ingests
  every finding into the backlog. The security-mode boot trigger reminds you to run it.
- **WSJF (SAFe) prioritization + bug severity + SLA** in the DevPipeline. A task's
  priority comes from a WSJF score (`pipeline.mjs add --wsjf uv,tc,rr,js` or
  `pipeline.mjs wsjf <id> …`), from **bug severity** (`--severity S1-S4`), or from
  scanner severity; the **SLA due date** follows the priority (config
  `pipeline.slaDays`) and the board flags ⏰ overdue. Logic in
  `pipeline-prioritize.mjs`, rendering in `pipeline-board.mjs`.
- **Bug taxonomy + known-bugs map.** Bug tasks carry `severity` (S1-S4) + `bugType`
  (functional/regression/security/performance/data/…); `pipeline.mjs sync` generates
  `contextkit/pipeline/known-bugs.md` (registry grouped by severity, open vs resolved,
  ⏰ overdue), and `pipeline.mjs bugs` prints/regenerates it.
- **`business-rules/` memory folder** — `contextkit/memory/business-rules/` with a
  versioned-rule `_TEMPLATE.md`, scaffolded on install and surfaced in
  `/setupcontextdevkit`. Mirrors the source platform's `docs/business-rules/`, kept in
  `contextkit/memory/` alongside the rest of the project's durable memory.
- **`security-team` squad (security & infra / DevSecOps)** in the squads manifest —
  groups `security` (AppSec + dependency/supply-chain) and `devops` (infra, CI/CD,
  release safety), with veto on the L5/L6 gates for Critical/High findings.
- **`/deps-audit` (security-team)** — deterministic dependency / supply-chain check
  (lockfile present, version pinning, plus native `npm`/`pnpm`/`yarn audit` CVEs when
  available) that emits findings into the DevPipeline backlog. Roadmap 1.0 #6.
- **`infra-security` agent (security-team)** — threat-models the platform the app
  runs on (IaC/cloud misconfig, IAM least-privilege, network exposure, secrets,
  container/runtime + CI/CD supply-chain hardening); pairs with `devops` (builds it)
  and `security` (AppSec). The security-team is now AppSec + infra + delivery.
- **Analysis → DevPipeline backlog flow.** `/bug-hunt`, `/analyze-code-ia-practices`,
  `/tech-debt-sweep`, and `/audit` now always emit a report **and** push each finding
  into the DevPipeline backlog, **auto-prioritized** by severity (RED→P1, yellow→P2,
  low→P3) and **idempotent**. New `pipeline.mjs ingest <findings.json>` and
  `pipeline.mjs prioritize <id> <P0-P3>` (the auto priority is **always editable** by
  the user). `tech-debt-scan --write` also emits `tech-debt-findings.json`.

### Changed
- **`install.mjs` refactored into focused modules** under `tools/install/` (cli,
  fs, project, git, uninstall). The entry point drops 487 → 234 lines — back under
  the 280-line constitution and out of the tech-debt RED ZONE. Behaviour-identical
  (the integration test drives the real installer end-to-end). Renamed
  `require_basename` → `requireBasename` to satisfy the kit's own naming rule.
- **All git/node calls go through `execFileSync` (no shell)** in `claim` and
  `release` — consistency + defense-in-depth.
- **`tech-debt-scan --ci`** added (exits non-zero on any RED-zone finding) and
  enforced as a CI step, so the kit can't regress past its own line-budget limit.
- **Deepened tier-2 QA agents** (`qa-unit`, `qa-perf`, `qa-e2e`) with anti-pattern
  tables + operational guidance (mocking strategy; visual-regression note), and
  **sharpened routing boundaries** — `architect` (dependency fit) vs `security`
  (supply-chain risk); `test-engineer` (devteam, L<4) vs `qa-orchestrator` (L≥4
  entry point). Roadmap 1.0 #5.

### Deprecated
- `/state`, `/context-doctor`, `/context-refresh` now carry a deprecation banner
  pointing to `/audit` (still fully functional); `/release` is noted as paired with
  `/claim`. Non-destructive first step of the 1.0 surface-trim (#1).

### Fixed
- Tech-debt marker detector no longer flags its own doc comment (a false positive
  in every sweep).

### Docs
- **Roadmap:** marked the squad families as shipped (v0.5.2); set a **1.0 — harden
  & prove** milestone before any L7; added **dependency & supply-chain control**
  (owned by `security-team`) as a 1.0 item.
- `/git` command description said "skill"; corrected to "command".
- **Roadmap:** added a **diverse & visual testing harness** future direction —
  browser-driven visual / regression testing with a **Python** option (Playwright /
  Selenium), owned by `qa-e2e` + `design-team`, gating "done" in `/ship`.
- **CONTRIBUTING:** documented the **public contracts** (config schema, installer
  flags, hook payload, `contextkit/` layout, command/agent names) as the 1.0 stability
  promise — breaking changes need an ADR + `/contract-check` (roadmap 1.0 #4).

### Security
- **Closed a shell-injection vector in `worktree-new`.** The base-branch argument
  was interpolated into a shell string (`execSync(\`git ... ${base}\`)`), so a
  crafted value like `"HEAD; rm -rf ~"` could run arbitrary commands. It now uses
  `execFileSync('git', argv)` (no shell), so the argument is a single literal git
  revision and a malicious value simply fails as an invalid reference.

## [0.5.2] - 2026-05-22

### Added
- **Squads as a first-class concept** — `contextkit/squads/README.md` manifest
  (rosters, when-to-use, **sovereignty** rule, grow guide), `_BRIEFING.md.tpl`
  (optional two-tier rich briefings), and the `/squad` command (show/route/brief/
  new-squad). Agents are now grouped: **devteam** + **qa-team** (existing), plus
  **compliance-team** (`privacy-lgpd` — standardized Brazilian LGPD skills: legal
  basis, consent, Art. 18 rights, retention/deletion, DPO, ANPD incidents,
  processors), **design-team** (`ux-designer`, `ui-designer`, `accessibility`
  WCAG AA), and starters for **product-team** (`product-owner`) and **ops-team**
  (`devops`). README suggests further squads (docs/data/growth/support) as
  templates. Now 18 agent archetypes; all install at Level 4.

## [0.5.1] - 2026-05-22

### Added
- **Safe `--update`** — `npx contextdevkit@latest --target . --update` refreshes the
  engine, slash commands, agents, and hook wiring **for the project's CURRENT
  level**, and **never touches** user-owned content: `CLAUDE.md`, `contextkit/config.json`
  (level + overrides preserved), memory (ADRs/sessions/roadmap/glossary), pipeline
  tasks, or scoped module `CLAUDE.md` files. New seed artifacts are added
  write-if-missing. Any plain re-run also now preserves the existing level instead
  of defaulting to 2.

## [0.5.0] - 2026-05-22

### Added
- **Version-control skill** — `/git` command + `git.mjs` diagnostics. Codifies the
  workflow (Conventional branches/commits — already hook-enforced — feature→PR, no
  direct push to default, rebase-sync, conflict handling via pre-push) and the
  **remote setup**: detects git/repo/remote/provider and whether `gh`/`glab` are
  installed+authed, and guides connecting GitHub/GitLab/other (install the CLI +
  create the repo, private by default). Wired into `/setupcontextdevkit` (6b),
  `/aidevtool-from0` (6b), the installer hint, and `doctor` (notes missing remote).
- **Modular CLAUDE.md** — each app/module gets its own scoped CLAUDE.md (like the
  source platform's `apps/api/CLAUDE.md` + `apps/mobile/CLAUDE.md`). `claude-md.mjs`
  (find/scaffold) detects module roots (`backend/`, `frontend/`, `api/`, `web/`,
  `mobile/`, and `apps/*`/`packages/*`/`modules/*`/`services/*`), `/claude-md`
  scaffolds + fills them, a `CLAUDE.child.md.tpl` is seeded, and `doctor` notes
  modules missing one. Wired into `/setupcontextdevkit` (Phase 4b) + `/aidevtool-from0`.
- **Product roadmap as a first-class artifact**: seeded `contextkit/memory/roadmap.md`
  (P-ID format), `/roadmap` command (new project → build it WITH the user;
  existing project → find a roadmap/PRD/spec to import, or analyze the code and
  **propose** one + ask the user for objectives), and `roadmap.mjs`
  (find/status/init). Wired into `/setupcontextdevkit` (Phase 5b) and
  `/aidevtool-from0` (Phase 4); `doctor` notes when the roadmap is undefined.
- **`/aidevtool-from0`** — bootstrap an empty project from zero: intelligent
  interactive product questionnaire → product vision, stack suggestion/refine
  (ADR), product **roadmap** (P-IDs), best-practices constitution, and a seeded
  DevPipeline. First-run boot now routes empty projects here, existing ones to
  `/setupcontextdevkit`.
- **Best-practices skill**: `contextkit/best-practices.md` (file-size budget +
  **intelligent** refactor-by-responsibility, SoC, naming, errors, docs) and
  `/analyze-code-ia-practices` — runs the scanner then proposes the *right*
  refactor per file (never random splits). New `practices.active` config; boot
  reminds when active.
- **DevPipeline** (execution control, distinct from the product roadmap):
  `contextkit/pipeline/{backlog,testing,conclusion}/` task files + generated
  `devpipeline.md` dashboard; `pipeline.mjs` (`add`/`move`/`sync`) and the
  `/pipeline` manager command. Bugs/increments/chores + roadmap items broken into
  tasks with priority + SLA. Synced on pre-commit.
- **Concurrency hardening (L3)** — robust against parallel sessions on the same
  machine AND different devs/machines:
  - `concurrency-guard.mjs` (`PreToolUse`): warns before you overwrite a file
    another active session edited recently, or that changed on disk since you
    last wrote it (covers full-file `Write`, which Claude Code's `Edit` freshness
    check doesn't).
  - `pre-push.mjs` git hook: fetches the upstream and **blocks a push that has a
    real textual conflict** with what was pushed there (`git merge-tree`); warns
    on auto-mergeable overlap. Bypass: `CONTEXT_ALLOW_CONFLICT_PUSH=1`.
  - SessionStart now lists **other active branches** (local worktrees + recent
    remote branches with author/age) for cross-machine awareness.
  - New config `l3.mainBranch` (upstream the conflict check compares against).
- **`/ship` automatic checkpoints** — `--auto` runs the pipeline through
  objective gates (no manual pause), still stopping on a red gate and before any
  irreversible action.
- **L6 — Autonomy & Insight** (new level): `/ship` (autonomous squad pipeline:
  design → implement → review → test → record, with checkpoints), `/retro`
  (learning loop turning recurring drift/debt into rules + ADRs), `/context-stats`
  (platform telemetry). No new hook — a capability tier on top of L5.
- **Deterministic tech-debt scanner** (`tech-debt-scan.mjs` + `tech-debt-detectors.mjs`):
  generic regex detectors (line budget, SRP "And/Or/E" names, TODO markers,
  React state-loops). `/tech-debt-sweep` now runs the scanner, then interprets.
- **Generic contract-drift** (`contract-scan.mjs` + `/contract-check`): declare
  `l5.contractGlobs`, snapshot exported symbols, flag removals/renames. CI-able.
- **Platform metrics** (`stats.mjs`): sessions, drift rate, cadence, ADR/agent counts.
- **`instrucoes.md`** — pt-BR usage guide (kit root + installed into projects).
- **`docs/ROADMAP.md`** — architect gap analysis vs the source system + L6 + future.
- New config: `l5.lineBudget`, `l5.contractGlobs`. Level range is now 1–6.

### Changed
- `/audit` now runs doctor + stats + tech-debt-scan + contract-scan deterministically.

## [0.4.1] - 2026-05-22

### Added
- **QA squad Tier 2**: `qa-perf` (benchmark/profile a hot path) and `qa-e2e`
  (critical user journeys through the real UI) agents — now 12 agent archetypes.
- **Release workflow** (`.github/workflows/release.yml`): pushing a `v*` tag runs
  the test suite, publishes to npm via the `NPM_TOKEN` secret, and creates the
  GitHub Release automatically.
- README demo/walkthrough of the `/setupcontextdevkit` flow.

### Note
- First release cut by the automated tag pipeline (validating it end-to-end).

## [0.4.0] - 2026-05-22

### Added
- **QA squad** (Level 4): `qa-orchestrator` (router + sign-off) plus `qa-unit`,
  `qa-integration`, `qa-fuzzer` specialists, and the `/test-plan`,
  `/scaffold-tests`, `/qa-signoff` commands. New `qa` config section
  (`criticalPaths`, `coverageTarget`); `detect-stack`/`setup-complete` suggest
  and apply `qa.criticalPaths`.
- **`/audit`** — one-pass health audit (doctor + tech-debt + QA + drift) with a
  prioritized action list; README documents running it on a schedule.
- **GitHub templates** installed into the target's `.github/` (PR template +
  bug/feature issue templates), written only if missing.
- **npm packaging**: `prepublishOnly` gates publish on the test suite.

### Notes
- Now ships 22 slash commands and 10 agent archetypes. Agents install at L ≥ 4.

## [0.3.0] - 2026-05-22

### Added
- **GitHub Actions CI** (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`) — runs the self-check and a
  full integration test on Node 18/20/22, plus a greenfield install smoke test.
- **`tools/integration-test.mjs`** — installs into a temp project and drives the
  real hooks through a true stdin pipe (drift block, L5 gate block + allow,
  first-run trigger, level rewire, doctor). Cross-platform, self-cleaning.
- **`/distill-sessions` + `/distill-apply`** — the auto-distill cycle the L5 Stop
  nudge referenced (propose CLAUDE.md refinements, then apply with an ADR).
- **`/context-doctor`** + `doctor.mjs` — diagnoses node version, config validity,
  hook wiring vs level, git hooks, memory scaffolding, and onboarding state.
- **`context-config.mjs`** — robust `show`/`set` backing `/context-config` (type
  coercion + optional zod validation), replacing free-form JSON editing.
- **Agent archetypes**: `test-engineer`, `security` (now 6 universal agents).
- **Installer**: `--help`, `--version`, `--uninstall [--purge]`, and a
  `.gitattributes` patch (keeps engine scripts LF on all platforms).
- **Packaging**: `files`, `repository`, `homepage`, `bugs`, and `npm test`.

### Notes
- `--uninstall` keeps your memory (`contextkit/memory/`) and `CLAUDE.md`; `--purge`
  additionally removes the engine, commands, and agents.

## [0.2.0] - 2026-05-22

### Added
- **First-run trigger** — the SessionStart hook surfaces a "First run" banner
  until onboarding completes, prompting `/setupcontextdevkit`.
- **`/setupcontextdevkit`** — one-shot self-configuring onboarding (detect stack,
  tune config, fill CLAUDE.md, seed glossary, scaffold agents, baseline ADR).
- **`detect-stack.mjs`** + **`setup-complete.mjs`** — read-only stack analyzer
  with suggested ledger/high-risk paths, applied via `--detect`.
- `npx github:reiTavares/ContextDevKit` import documented.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-05-22

### Added
- Initial release: portable, level-based (L1–L5) AI dev platform for Claude Code.
- Engine: 4 hooks (boot context, edit ledger, drift nudge, L5 risk gate),
  config-driven path classification, zero-dependency BOM-safe config loader.
- Installer with greenfield/existing detection and idempotent settings
  composition. 14 slash commands, agent archetypes, ADR/session/glossary
  scaffolding, and docs.
